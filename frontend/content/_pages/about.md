# About Me

**I'm Andres Castro, a working-class advocate, software engineer, and community organizer running for Congress in Georgia's 5th District.** I'm not a politician. I'm someone who knows what it's like to struggle, fight, and overcome challenges that working families face every day.

I grew up in **Marietta and Powder Springs**, raised by an immigrant mother from **Acapulco, Mexico**. Early on, I faced poverty, racism, and systemic barriers, but determination and grit got me through **Kennesaw State University**, where I earned my **Computer Science degree** while working multiple jobs. Today, I'm proud to be a homeowner in **Oakland City, Atlanta**, proof that hard work and persistence can still pay off in America.

But individual success doesn't mean much if our families and communities are left behind. My wife, a passionate feminist advocate, has taught me the strength of standing firm in our values, even when facing tough conversations and political divides. My younger brother, wrapping up his service in the Coast Guard, and my older sister, a small-business owner who's now helping with this campaign, remind me every day why we need leaders who understand the reality of working people. And my niece, about to graduate from **Georgia State University** with a degree in game design, embodies the future we're fighting to protect.

Family has always been everything to me. I was lucky enough to buy **two side-by-side homes** so we could stay close. Now, I'm running for Congress because every family in our district deserves that same chance—to stay together, afford a home, and have real opportunities for success.
