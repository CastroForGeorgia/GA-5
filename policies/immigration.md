# Immigration Policy

## Overview

Immigration is a cornerstone of the American dream, enriching our communities with diverse talents, cultures, and perspectives. Our immigration policy for **Georgia's 5th Congressional District** is rooted in compassion, fairness, and the recognition of immigrants' invaluable contributions to our society. Inspired by personal experience, we advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that provides stability and opportunities for all immigrants, ensuring that our district remains a beacon of hope and prosperity.

## Personal Story

My commitment to immigration reform is deeply personal. My mother immigrated to the United States illegally, driven by the hope of providing a better life for our family. Despite the challenges she faced, her resilience and determination led her to be granted amnesty, and eventually, she became a U.S. citizen. My story is proof that with the right support, immigrants can thrive and contribute significantly to our economy and society. It also underscores that mass deportation is neither necessary nor beneficial for our nation's growth and diversity.
