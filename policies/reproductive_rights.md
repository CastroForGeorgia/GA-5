# Women's Reproductive Rights and Care Policy

## Overview

It's time we faced the truth: the political establishment has failed women across this country. They've promised to protect our rights, yet time and again, they've let us down. Women's reproductive rights and healthcare have been chipped away, leaving many without access to essential services. In **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, we're standing up and saying enough is enough. Every woman deserves the fundamental right to make decisions about her own body and to access comprehensive reproductive healthcare. This is not a privilege—it's a basic human right. We're committed to fighting tirelessly to ensure that these rights are not only protected but expanded.
