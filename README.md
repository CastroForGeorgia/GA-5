## üßë‚Äçüíº About Andres Castro

### **A Journey Forged in Resilience and Unity**

Hello, I'm Andres Castro. My story begins on September 14, 1988, in Los Angeles, California. My mother's courageous journey from Acapulco, Mexico, in search of a better life embodies the spirit of millions who dream of opportunity and justice. After enduring years of hardship and abuse, she made the brave decision to move us‚Äîmy older sister and me‚Äîto Georgia, leaving behind everything she knew to give us a fighting chance.

Facing extreme poverty, we sometimes resorted to dumpster diving just to find our next meal. But through unwavering solidarity, resilience, and an unshakable belief in a better tomorrow, we overcame every obstacle that stood in our way.

Growing up in Marietta and Powder Springs, attending Heards Ferry Elementary, Tapp Middle, and McEachern High, I was embraced by the heart of metro Atlanta. These communities instilled in me the values of hard work, perseverance, and the power of standing together. Despite the crushing weight of poverty, I was determined not just to rise above our circumstances but to pave the way for others facing similar struggles.

When the 2008 recession hit, we‚Äîlike countless hardworking families‚Äîfaced the terrifying threat of losing our home. The system was rigged against us, favoring the wealthy and powerful, but through collective strength and relentless effort, we held on. This pivotal experience showed me firsthand how ordinary people suffer when the odds are stacked against them.

With the lifelines of Pell Grants, the HOPE Grant, and Federal Student Loans, I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a degree in Computer Science. Without these crucial supports, higher education would have remained a distant dream‚Äîjust as it does for too many Americans today. My education ignited a passion for technology and innovation and reinforced my belief that everyone deserves access to affordable education.

Since 2018, I‚Äôve been a proud homeowner in Oakland City, Atlanta‚Äînot just for myself, but also providing a safe haven for my extended family. My younger brother serves honorably in the U.S. Coast Guard, and my older sister‚Äîwho became a mother at 17‚Äîfought her way out of poverty and managed to put my niece through college. Our family's journey mirrors the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans everywhere. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the challenges we face and strengthened my conviction that the American Dream must be accessible to **all**‚Äînot just the privileged few.

I have also seen firsthand the impacts poverty has on all Americans, regardless of race or ethnic background, through the experiences of my wife, Megan Castro. Megan is from Waycross, Georgia‚Äîone of the state's poorest cities. She faced the same hardships of poverty, but with her family's support, she attended Georgia State University and strived for a better life. Like so many of us, she now carries the burden of student loan debt. Our shared experiences reinforce my understanding that economic struggles transcend race and background, fueling my determination to fight for a system that works for everyone.

As a Staff Software Engineer, I tackle complex problems every day. This experience gives me a unique perspective on how we can harness technology to serve the public good. I believe we can use innovation to make our government more transparent, efficient, and responsive to the needs of all people‚Äînot just corporate interests. By breaking down the barriers that keep ordinary citizens from engaging with their government, we can create a democracy that truly works for **everyone**.

### **Why I'm Running**

- **Championing Equal Opportunity:**
  - My life story proves that when we invest in people, **everyone** thrives. With the right support, every American‚Äînot just the wealthy‚Äîcan contribute meaningfully to our society. I'm committed to tearing down the barriers that prevent too many from reaching their full potential and to building pathways that empower us all to achieve the American Dream.

- **A Voice for the People, Not the Powerful:**
  - It's time to put the needs of working people above corporate profits and political elites. The current leadership has ignored critical issues like income inequality, healthcare, and human rights for too long. I bring a fresh, independent voice dedicated to fighting for the interests of the people of Georgia's 5th District‚Äînot the billionaire class. I pledge to champion policies that uplift our community and drive economic justice for all.

- **Transparency and Accountability for Everyone:**
  - Our democracy flourishes when it's truly **of, by, and for the people**. I believe in dismantling the walls that separate citizens from their government. By embracing open platforms like GitHub, we can ensure transparency and accountability, allowing everyone to actively participate in shaping policies. Together, we'll build an inclusive and participatory democracy that leaves no one behind.

- **Harnessing Technology for the Greater Good:**
  - In the 21st century, we must leverage technology to serve the many, not just the few. My background as a Staff Engineer equips me with the skills to modernize our government, making it more efficient and responsive. I'm committed to using technology to enhance our infrastructure, protect data privacy, and implement solutions that benefit all of us‚Äînot corporations and special interests. By embracing innovation, we can tackle complex challenges and create a government that works better for **everyone**.
