## Hyperlocal Organizing

Georgia's 5th District is a collection of diverse communities, each with unique challenges and strengths. Our neighborhood-based organizing approach ensures that every community has a voice in our campaign and that our platform reflects the real experiences of constituents.

## How Neighborhood Hubs Work

Each neighborhood hub serves as a bridge between our digital campaign infrastructure and local community organizing. Hub leaders coordinate:

- **Local Issue Tracking** - Identifying and documenting neighborhood-specific challenges
- **Community Events** - House parties, canvassing events, and town halls
- **Policy Feedback** - Ensuring local voices inform our platform development
- **Voter Outreach** - Targeted outreach strategies for each community
- **Mutual Aid** - Connecting campaign work with ongoing community support efforts

## Current Neighborhood Hubs

Our organizing model starts with established communities and grows organically based on volunteer leadership and local interest.

**Oakland City** - Our pilot neighborhood hub, demonstrating how open source organizing can strengthen existing community networks.

**More Coming Soon** - Interested in starting a hub in your neighborhood? We provide training, resources, and support to help you get started.

## The Neighborhood Leader Handbook

Becoming a neighborhood leader means taking ownership of organizing in your community while staying connected to the broader campaign. Our handbook provides everything you need to know about facilitating community conversations, organizing events, and feeding local insights back into campaign strategy.
