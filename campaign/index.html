This is more than a campaign. It's a public infrastructure project.

We're building the first community-governed campaign infrastructure for GA-05, where transparency isn't just a promise—it's built into every process. From policy development to field organizing, everything happens in the open.

## Our Three North Stars

🏘️ **Housing** – A home should be a human right, not a hedge fund.  
🏥 **Healthcare** – Everyone in, nobody out.  
💼 **Workers' Rights** – 40 hours should be enough to live with dignity.

## How It Works

This campaign operates like an open source software project. Contributors from across GA-05 submit ideas, improvements, and feedback through GitHub. Every proposal is reviewed transparently, and the best ideas become part of our platform.

Whether you're a seasoned organizer or new to politics, there's a place for you here.
