## Where Strategy Meets Action

Campaign HQ is the nerve center of our open source campaign. This is where our most strategic work happensâ€”from developing comprehensive policy positions to building the digital tools that amplify our organizing.

## Our Departments

**Policy Lab** - Collaborative policy development across housing, healthcare, and economic justice. Every proposal is developed transparently with community input.

**Communications** - Press releases, social media strategy, and weekly campaign updates. Help us craft messages that resonate with voters.

**Design Hub** - Visual identity, campaign materials, and digital assets. Bring your creative skills to build a compelling campaign brand.

**Tech & Data** - Digital infrastructure, automation tools, and data analysis. Build the technology that powers modern organizing.

**Field Operations** - On-the-ground organizing updates and community feedback integration. Connect digital work with real-world impact.

## How Departments Work Together

Unlike traditional campaigns where departments work in isolation, our open source approach means everything is interconnected. Policy research informs communications strategy. Field feedback shapes policy priorities. Design work supports both digital organizing and in-person events.

This collaborative approach ensures our campaign speaks with one voice while benefiting from diverse perspectives and expertise.
