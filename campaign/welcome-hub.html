## New to Our Campaign?

The Welcome Hub is designed to get you oriented and involved quickly. Whether you're a first-time volunteer or an experienced organizer, we'll help you find your place in our movement.

## Getting Started is Easy

1. **Say Hello** - Introduce yourself in our community discussions

3. **Start Contributing** - Jump into issues, events, or ongoing projects
4. **Build Community** - Connect with neighbors and fellow supporters

## Why Open Source Campaigning?

Traditional campaigns operate in silos, with decisions made behind closed doors. We believe the people deserve to see exactly how their campaign operates—and to help shape it.

Every policy position, every organizational decision, every line of code that powers our digital infrastructure is developed transparently. This isn't just about accountability—it's about building a truly people-powered movement.
