## Honoring the Legacy of John Lewis  
John Lewis taught us that leadership is about service, about seeing injustice and summoning the courage to act. His legacy is a call to all of us—not to simply admire his work but to continue it. His fight for civil rights, voting rights, and economic justice laid the foundation for the progress we see today. But our work is far from finished.  

I am running because I believe our district deserves leadership that not only honors this legacy but builds upon it with bold, forward-thinking solutions to the challenges of today and tomorrow.

## A Shared Cause, A Different Approach  
Representative Nikema Williams has worked tirelessly to advocate for the people of Georgia’s 5th District, and I deeply respect her dedication and service. We share a common cause: to uplift working families, protect civil rights, and ensure opportunity for all. Where we may differ is in the vision and execution of how to achieve these goals.  

As we face an increasingly complex future shaped by rapid technological advancements and the impending use of artificial intelligence technologies in the workplace, I believe we need leadership with a deep understanding of these challenges. My background as a software engineer and advocate for equity has given me the tools to address these issues in innovative ways. I bring a perspective grounded in technical expertise and a commitment to ensuring that technological progress benefits everyone—not just the privileged few.

## Why Now?  
I am running now because the stakes for our community and our nation have never been higher. Automation and artificial intelligence are reshaping our workforce. Housing affordability is slipping further out of reach for too many families. And our democracy itself faces threats that require vigilance and action.  

These challenges demand leaders who can blend progressive values with the technical knowledge to create practical, effective solutions. We must better understand the systems and tools shaping our future to ensure our values are heard and implemented.

## A Vision for the Future  
My vision for the 5th District is rooted in empowerment and opportunity:  
- **Affordable Housing**: Expanding housing affordability through innovative programs like the $200k Housing Program to ensure working families can live and thrive in the communities they love.  
- **Economic Justice**: Preparing for the future of work by addressing the impact of automation, investing in reskilling programs, and holding corporations accountable for fair wages and taxes.  
- **Universal Healthcare**: Advocating for a healthcare system that guarantees access to quality care for every person in our district, regardless of income or employment.  
- **Community Empowerment**: Engaging directly with residents to co-create policies that reflect their needs and priorities, ensuring that government is transparent, inclusive, and accessible to all.  

## Moving Forward Together  
This campaign is about building on the strong foundation of the past while boldly stepping into the future. It’s about ensuring that the legacy of John Lewis is not just preserved but expanded to meet the challenges of today. It’s about working together—as neighbors, as a community, and as a movement—to create a district that works for everyone.  

I am running because I believe in the power of the 5th District and its people. I am running because I know we can unite as a working class in this moment together. My family, neighbors, and the diverse communities of Georgia's 5th District are all up against similar odds.
