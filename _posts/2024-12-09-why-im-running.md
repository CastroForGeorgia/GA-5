## Honoring the Legacy of John Lewis  
John Lewis taught us that leadership is about service—about seeing injustice and summoning the courage to act. His legacy is a **call to action** for all of us—not to simply admire his work but to **continue it**. His fight for civil rights, voting rights, and economic justice laid the foundation for the progress we see today. But our work is far from finished.  

I am running because I believe our district deserves leadership that not only **honors this legacy** but builds upon it with **bold, forward-thinking solutions** to the challenges of today and tomorrow.

## A Shared Cause, A Different Approach  
Representative Nikema Williams has worked tirelessly to advocate for the people of Georgia’s 5th District, and I deeply respect her dedication and service. We share a common cause: to uplift working families, protect civil rights, and ensure opportunity for all.  

Where we differ is in **vision and execution**. As automation, artificial intelligence, and corporate greed reshape our economy, our district needs leadership that understands these challenges firsthand.  

- My background as a **software engineer** gives me a unique perspective to address the **threats and opportunities** posed by rapid technological advancements.  
- My advocacy for **economic justice and equity** means every policy I put forward will reflect the struggles and dreams of working-class families—not the interests of corporations or the wealthy few.

## Why Now?  

The challenges we face as a community and as a nation demand bold action, not incrementalism.  

- **Automation and AI** are transforming our workforce, leaving too many workers behind.  
- **Housing affordability** is slipping further out of reach for working families.  
- **Healthcare** remains inaccessible for too many, while reproductive rights hang in the balance.  
- **Our democracy itself** faces unprecedented threats that require vigilance and bold leadership.  

These challenges require leaders who can blend **progressive values with technical knowledge** to create **practical, effective solutions**. We cannot allow outdated approaches to hold us back as we navigate the complexities of this new era.

## A Vision for the Future  

My campaign is about **empowerment and opportunity** for every resident of Georgia’s 5th District.  

### 🏠 **Affordable Housing**  
- Expand housing access through innovative initiatives like **The Workers’ Housing Guarantee** (formerly the $200k Home Program) to provide affordable, sustainable homes for working families.  

### 💼 **Economic Justice**  
- Prepare for the **future of work** by investing in reskilling programs and ensuring that automation benefits workers, not just corporations.  
- Hold corporations accountable for paying fair wages and contributing their share to our economy.  

### ❤️ **Universal Healthcare**  
- Fight for a healthcare system that guarantees access to **quality, affordable care** for every resident—regardless of income, employment, or immigration status.  

### 🤝 **Community Empowerment**  
- Prioritize **community-led policy development** through town halls, open government platforms, and direct engagement.  
- Ensure transparency and accessibility so every voice in our district is heard and valued.

## Moving Forward Together  

This campaign is about **building on the foundation** laid by leaders like John Lewis while stepping boldly into the future. It’s about ensuring that the struggles of working families, immigrants, LGBTQ+ communities, and marginalized groups are **at the center of every decision we make**.  

I am running because I believe in the **strength and resilience** of the 5th District. We are a diverse, vibrant community capable of incredible progress when we stand together.

## **We Are Family**  

Our shared experiences and struggles bind us together. No matter who you are or where you come from:  

### **If you grew up poor** – *We are family!*  
### **If you grew up a single mother** – *We are family!*  
### **If you serve in the military** – *We are family!*  
### **If you are Palestinian** – *We are family!*  
### **If you are LGBTQ+** – *We are family!*  
### **If you worry for your partner’s reproductive rights** – *We are family!*  
### **If you have to use the prison system for mental healthcare** – *We are family!*
