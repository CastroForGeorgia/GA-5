# The Democratic Party Has Lost Its Way

The Democratic Party, once the fierce champion of the working class, has been swallowed by corporate influence—trading the fight for economic justice, civil rights, and opportunity for all in favor of profit over people. I’m running for Congress in **Georgia’s 5th District** because I refuse to stand by while millions of hardworking Americans are left behind. It’s time to take our party back to its roots and demand leadership that puts people first.

## A Party at a Crossroads

Too many Democratic leaders have become comfortable with the status quo, offering incremental changes that never truly challenge the systems holding us down. This complacency has taken a real toll on working families across **Georgia’s 5th Congressional District** and beyond. It’s why we still lack universal healthcare and why our bills—insurance, gas, utilities—keep rising. Our party must decide whether it will be a force for transformative progress or a footnote in corporate America’s ledger.

## I Am Not From the Left or the Right—I’m From the Bottom

I know what it means to struggle and to juggle everyday costs that always seem to climb. When politicians take corporate donations, they ignore the rest of us. That’s why I will never accept corporate money—my loyalty belongs to the people who live paycheck to paycheck, to the renters, to the families in need of real representation right here in **GA-05**.

## Choosing a Side

As a Democrat running in **Georgia’s 5th District**, I’ve witnessed two types of leaders in the party:

- **Those who see change as essential**—because their lives and freedoms depend on it.  
- **Those who see it as a nice idea**—supporting it in theory but never feeling its urgency.

For those of us in **congressional 5th district** who can’t afford to wait, incrementalism is not an option. Our party can’t treat issues of justice and equity like slogans. We need bold, sweeping action.

## My Vision for Change: A Political Multiplier

This campaign isn’t just about winning a seat—it’s about building a movement. I aim to be a **political multiplier** by uplifting voices across communities and leveraging every tool—especially technology—to make politics more inclusive. Together, we can create a coalition of working-class Americans ready to hold our leaders accountable and return the Democratic Party to its rightful place: on the side of everyday people in **Georgia’s 5th District** and nationwide.

## Time for a Political Revolution

The corporate takeover of the Democratic Party has left it disconnected, uninspired, and out of touch with those who need real change the most. **It’s time to clean house.** Our future depends on electing leaders who are unapologetically loyal to their communities, not corporate donors.

I’m running in **GA-05** because it’s not about me—it’s about all of us who’ve been ignored for too long. We need a government that serves the people, not the powerful. **I will not hold back. I will not be bought.** Join me, and let’s reclaim our party—and our future—together in **Georgia’s 5th Congressional District**.
