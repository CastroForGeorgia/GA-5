# The Democratic Party Has Lost Its Way

The Democratic Party has strayed from its roots as the champion of the working class and become a vehicle for corporate interests. This corruption has shattered the party’s base, leaving millions of Americans—myself included—disillusioned and demanding change. I’m running for Congress because I can no longer stand by and watch the party I love fail the very people it claims to represent.

## I Am Not From the Left or the Right—I’m From the Bottom

As someone who has been working class all my life, I understand the struggles of everyday people in a way the current establishment never will. **I will not be taking corporate money now or ever.** My loyalty lies with the people—not the corporations, not the lobbyists, and not the political elite who have allowed themselves to be bought.

The failures of the Democratic Party are why we don’t have [universal healthcare](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00197228&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C). They are why your [home insurance is skyrocketing](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00040253&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C), [your gas bill keeps climbing](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=gas&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C), and your Georgia [power bill goes up](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00119776&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C). Instead of fighting for the people, party leaders have aligned themselves with the highest bidders. Their votes show complicity, not courage. Their actions prioritize corporate profits over your well-being.

## A Party That Has Lost Its Way

In my journey as a Democrat—and now as a candidate in GA-05—I’ve noticed two groups in our party:

- **Those for whom progressive change is essential.** Their freedoms, livelihoods, and survival depend on it. For them, the fight for justice and equity is deeply personal.

- **Those for whom progressive change is a nice idea.** Something they support in principle but that doesn’t impact their well-being. For them, politics is about optics, not survival.

The challenge arises when these two groups collide, especially when the latter holds power. **The establishment has cemented its heels on the side of corporate influence.** For them, the status quo is comfortable, their privilege intact. But when a new voice emerges to challenge this system, it’s seen as disruptive—not because it threatens their freedoms, but because it threatens their hold on power.

## We Can’t Let Leadership Be Bought

My opponent, [Representative Nikema Williams](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/nikema-williams/summary?cid=N00047361&cycle=CAREER), has consistently benefited from campaign contributions by industries like health insurance, pharmaceuticals, and Wall Street banks—industries that give not out of goodwill, but to secure influence. Leaders who rely on these contributions cannot be trusted to fight the battles that matter most to working families. **Their refusal to take bold stances shows that this is not about doing what’s right but about following the money and influence.**

For example, [Nikema Williams’s OpenSecrets profile](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/nikema-williams/summary?cid=N00047361&cycle=CAREER) reveals contributions from companies like:

- [Elevance Health, Inc. PAC (formerly Anthem)](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00197228&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C), which contributed $4,000.
- [Aflac PAC](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00034157&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C), which donated over $5,000.
- [Truist Financial PAC](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00386524&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C), which contributed $5,000.
- [BlackRock PAC](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?cycle=2024&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00752584&contributor_name=C00479246&two_year_transaction_period=2024&line_number=F3-11C), which maxed out their donation at $10,000.

Even more concerning is the role of lobbying groups like AIPAC, which heavily influence elections. **AIPAC and its affiliates spent over $25 million** to unseat progressive voices like Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Cori Bush (D-Mo.), who challenged the status quo ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/13/progressives-aipac-elections-threat-00173709)). By accepting contributions from these organizations, [Representative Williams](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/nikema-williams/summary?cid=N00047361&cycle=CAREER) contributes to a system designed to suppress progressives advocating for the working class and equity.

> **This is how influence works: by taking their money, you show your allegiances.**

## My Vision for Change: A Political Multiplier

I will not sit around and wait for votes to come. **My vision for change is to be a political multiplier—a leader who doesn’t just represent their district but empowers others to fight for change at every level of government.** I will look to my district, to my state, and beyond to support those who stand up to the current establishment and demand accountability. Together, we will return the Democratic Party to its roots as the party of the working class.

We will use every tool at our disposal, including cutting-edge technology, to organize, mobilize, and build a movement for real change. This is not just about winning one seat; **it’s about transforming a broken system.**

## Time for a Political Revolution

The corporate takeover of the Democratic Party has shattered its foundation. Instead of causing “good trouble” as the late John Lewis advocated, too many Democrats play it safe, choosing their battles based on the highest payer. **It’s time to clean house, to root out the corruption, and to make way for leaders who will fight for the people—not the powerful.**

This is why I’m running. **This campaign is not about me; it’s about us.** It’s about building a movement that empowers the working class, uplifts marginalized communities, and restores integrity to the Democratic Party. Together, we can create a future where justice, equity, and opportunity are not just ideals, but realities.
