# The Democratic Party Has Lost Its Way  

The Democratic Party was once the champion of the working class—a party that fought for economic justice, civil rights, and opportunity for all. But over time, it has been swallowed by corporate influence, putting profit over people and power over principle. This has left millions of working-class Americans—myself included—disillusioned and demanding change.  

I’m running for Congress because I refuse to accept that this is the best we can do. The party I believe in—the party that should fight for workers, for struggling families, for those whose voices are ignored—needs to be reclaimed. It’s time for leaders who aren’t afraid to stand up to corporate interests and put people first.  

## I Am Not From the Left or the Right—I’m From the Bottom  

I know what it means to struggle. I know what it’s like to work paycheck to paycheck, to navigate systems that seem built to hold us back, and to see leaders who claim to fight for us but fail to act when it matters.  

That’s why I will never take corporate money. **My loyalty is to the people—not corporations, not lobbyists, and not the political elite who have allowed themselves to be bought.**  

The failures of today’s Democratic Party are why we don’t have universal healthcare. They are why your home insurance is skyrocketing, your gas bill keeps climbing, and your Georgia power bill goes up. Instead of fighting for working families, too many leaders have chosen to protect the interests of the wealthy and well-connected.  

That’s not leadership. That’s complicity.  

## A Party That Must Choose a Side  

In my journey as a Democrat—and now as a candidate in GA-05—I’ve seen two groups in our party:  

- **Those for whom progressive change is essential.** Their freedoms, livelihoods, and survival depend on it.  
- **Those for whom progressive change is a nice idea.** Something they support in theory, but that doesn’t impact their lives in a meaningful way.  

The establishment has too often aligned with the latter, treating justice and equity as slogans rather than necessities. They are comfortable with slow, incremental change that never disrupts the status quo. But for working-class people, for struggling families, for those of us who can’t afford to wait, that is not enough.  

We need bold action. And we need it now.  

## My Vision for Change: A Political Multiplier  

This campaign is bigger than one election. **I’m not just running to win a seat—I’m running to build a movement.**  

Real change happens when we organize, mobilize, and uplift leaders at every level who refuse to be bought. My vision is to be a **political multiplier**—a representative who doesn’t just fight for my district but empowers others to take up this fight in their own communities. We will build a coalition of working-class people demanding accountability and pushing the Democratic Party back to its roots.  

We will use every tool at our disposal, including cutting-edge technology, to make politics accessible and to bring more people into the fight. Because this isn’t just about policy—it’s about power. And it’s time to take that power back.  

## Time for a Political Revolution  

The corporate takeover of the Democratic Party has left it weak, uninspired, and disconnected from the people it claims to serve. **It’s time to clean house.** It’s time to replace the transactional politics of today with leadership that is bold, unafraid, and deeply rooted in the struggles of everyday people.  

This is why I’m running. **This campaign is not about me; it’s about us.** It’s about workers, renters, parents, and young people who are tired of being ignored. It’s about restoring integrity to our politics and ensuring that our government works for the people—not the powerful.  

**I will not hold back. I will not be bought. Join me, and let’s fight together to take back our party and our future.**
