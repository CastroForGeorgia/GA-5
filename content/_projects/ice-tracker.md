# ICE Activity Tracker

In the face of continued threats from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), knowledge and community solidarity are our strongest defenses. The ICE Activity Tracker at [AvoidThis.Zone](https://avoidthis.zone/) is a crowdsourced platform designed to help residents across Georgia report and avoid ICE activity safely and anonymously.

## Why this Matters

Immigrant communities in Georgia face constant anxiety over potential ICE raids, which tear apart families, disrupt lives, and harm entire communities. Our ICE Activity Tracker empowers individuals to share critical alerts about ICE movements, ensuring communities can stay informed, vigilant, and protected.

## How it Works

* **Real-Time Updates:** Reports are aggregated and displayed regionally, providing timely awareness and fostering community vigilance.
* **Safety First:** Designed with privacy and anonymity in mind, ensuring community safety and trust.

## Join the Movement

Stay informed and help protect your community. Visit [AvoidThis.Zone](https://avoidthis.zone/) to participate, report sightings, and stand in solidarity against unjust immigration enforcement.

Together, we create safer communities.
