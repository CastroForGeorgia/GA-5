# 🗳️ Castro for Georgia — Open Source Campaign

Welcome to the open-source repository for the Castro for Georgia congressional campaign (GA-05). Think of this as our public bulletin board—a place to see what we're working on, what needs to be done, and how our campaign is organized.

**To join the team and start contributing, your first step is to join our campaign Discord.** This is where we coordinate, collaborate in real-time, and welcome new members.

## 🎯 Our North Stars

Everything we do is in service of three core goals:

1.  🏘️ **Housing** – A home should be a human right, not a commodity.
2.  🏥 **Healthcare** – Everyone in, nobody out.
3.  💼 **Workers' Rights** – 40 hours of work should be enough to live with dignity.
