# 🗳️ Castro for Georgia — Open Source Campaign

Welcome to the open-source repository powering the Castro for Georgia congressional campaign (GA‑05).  
This repo is part platform, part organizing toolkit, and part civic experiment.

We're building the first community-governed campaign infrastructure—where **every door knock, line of code, and policy idea is contributed in public**.

## 🎯 Our North Stars

1. 🏘️ **Housing** – A home should be a human right, not a hedge fund.
2. 🏥 **Healthcare** – Everyone in, nobody out.
3. 💼 **Workers' Rights** – 40 hours should be enough to live with dignity.

**This is more than a campaign. It's a public infrastructure project.**  
Let's build it together—one pull request, door knock, and policy doc at a time.
