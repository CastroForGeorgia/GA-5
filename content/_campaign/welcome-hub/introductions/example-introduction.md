# ✍️ How to Introduce Yourself

Welcome! This is a simple template to help you post your first introduction in the campaign's 👋 Introductions Discussion on GitHub.

You don't need to be technical or have any GitHub experience to participate.  
Just copy the text below, paste it into a new post in [Discussions](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/discussions/categories/introductions), and fill in the blanks.

Your intro helps us:
- Know who's joining the movement
- Match you with the right team or neighborhood
- Celebrate the skills and experiences you bring
