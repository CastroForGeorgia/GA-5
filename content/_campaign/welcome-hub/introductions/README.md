# 👋 Welcome to Introductions

This is your starting place to meet the Castro for Georgia community.  
We're building the first fully open-source grassroots campaign in the country—and we're glad you're here.

### 🧭 Here's what to do:

1. **Meet the Team**  
   → See [leadership.md](./leadership.md) to learn about campaign leads and GitHub maintainers.

2. **Introduce Yourself**  
   → Post a short hello in our [👋 Introductions Discussion](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/discussions/categories/introductions).  
   You'll be greeted by a teammate and guided toward a task you can jump into right away.

3. **Get Onboarded**  
   → Read our [Quick Start Guide](../get-involved/quick-start-guide.md) to make your first contribution (no coding required).
