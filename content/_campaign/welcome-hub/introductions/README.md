We’re building the first fully open-source grassroots campaign in the country—and we’re glad you’re here.

### 🧭 Here's what to do:

1. **Meet the Team**

2. **Introduce Yourself**  
   → Post a short hello in our [👋 Introductions Discussion](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/discussions/categories/introductions).  
   You’ll be greeted by a teammate and guided toward a task you can jump into right away.

3. **Get Onboarded**
