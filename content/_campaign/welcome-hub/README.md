# 🌟 Welcome to the Castro for Georgia Open-Source Campaign!

Welcome! You're stepping into something special. This is your central hub for learning about our campaign, discovering how you can contribute, and understanding the guidelines that keep our community safe and productive.

Most political campaigns run behind closed doors—decisions hidden, policies drafted by insiders, and strategies kept from the very people they impact. **We're doing things differently.**

While this GitHub repository is where we store our materials, our entire campaign is organized on **Discord**. It's our real-time hub for all communication, collaboration, and community building. All active work happens there.

> This is more than a campaign. It's a new model of organizing.

## 🌟 Our Vision: Three North Stars

Our campaign is a movement to build a future where every working family in Georgia's 5th District thrives. Our vision is built around three core "North Stars":

1.  **A Home You Can Afford & Keep** 🏘️: We believe housing is a fundamental human right and will work to ensure affordable housing for all, strengthen tenant protections, and support community ownership models.
2.  **Healthcare Is a Human Right** ❤️‍🩹: We envision a future without medical debt where everyone has access to the care they need. We support Medicare for All, expanded healthcare access, and the protection of reproductive rights.
3.  **Dignified Work & A Fair Economy** 💪: Every Georgian deserves a job that pays fair wages, stability, and respect. We advocate for a living wage, the right to unionize, and legislation that holds corporations accountable.
