# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ðŸ¤”

Here are some common questions we've heard about our campaign and how we're using open-source practices. Don't see your question? Feel free to ask in our [Discussions](../../discussions)!

## ðŸ“Œ General Questions

### **What exactly is an open-source campaign?**

Think of it like a neighborhood potluckâ€”everyone contributes openly, ideas are shared freely, and the whole community benefits. Our campaign works similarly: all plans, policies, and materials are open for everyone to see, discuss, and improve.

### **Why run an open-source campaign?**

We believe transparency builds trust and leads to better solutions. When everyone can contribute, we tap into our collective wisdom, creativity, and energy, making our campaign stronger and more reflective of the community's needs.

## ðŸ“Œ Participation & Contributions

### **Do I need technical skills or coding experience to participate?**

Not at all! Most contributions involve simple things like suggesting ideas, reviewing materials, or improving text. We welcome everyone's unique skills and perspectives.

### **How can I make my first contribution?**

You can start small: fix a typo, join a discussion, or log a quick idea or issue. Check out our [Quick-Start Guide](../get-involved/quick-start-guide.md) for easy steps.

### **Will my name or personal information be public?**

Only your GitHub username will appear publicly. You can choose a username that keeps your identity private if you prefer. We never share personal voter or community member information publicly.

## ðŸ“Œ Privacy & Safety

### **What about voter data and privacy?**

We take privacy very seriously. No personal voter data (names, addresses, phone numbers) is ever shared openly. If an issue or task involves personal details, it's handled securely through our internal systems.

### **How do you handle disagreements or conflicts?**

We foster respectful, open discussions. If disagreements arise, we discuss transparently to find common ground. Our [Governance Model](./governance-model.md) explains how conflicts are resolved fairly and respectfully.

## ðŸ“Œ Using GitHub

### **What's GitHub and why use it?**

GitHub is an online tool originally designed for software developers to collaborate. We use it because it helps us manage documents, tasks, and discussions transparently, allowing anyone to easily contribute and follow the campaign's progress.

### **What's an Issue, Pull Request, or Merge?**

* **Issue:** Think of it as a note pinned on a community boardâ€”a task, suggestion, or improvement.
* **Pull Request (PR):** A formal suggestion for changes that others review before approval.
* **Merge:** Accepting someone's suggestion into our official materials.

## ðŸ“Œ Getting More Help

### **I'm stuck or confusedâ€”where do I go for help?**

Reach out anytime:

* **Discussions:** Post questions and someone from our team will help.
* **Community Mentor:** Connect with a mentor who can guide you personally.
