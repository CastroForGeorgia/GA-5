# Open Source 101: A Beginner's Guide üå±

**Ever wondered what "open source" means, and why our campaign uses it?**

## So, what exactly is Open Source?

Imagine a community potluck dinner. Everyone brings a dish, shares recipes openly, and helps set up and clean up. The whole community benefits because everything is visible, collaborative, and shared.

Open-source takes this idea online:

* **Visibility:** Everything (policies, strategies, tasks) is public and easy to find.
* **Collaboration:** Anyone can suggest improvements or new ideas, just like bringing a dish to the potluck.
* **Sharing:** All materials can be used by others freely, spreading good ideas widely.

## Why does this matter in politics?

Traditional political campaigns often keep their strategies hidden‚Äîlike secret recipes. But when campaigns operate openly:

* **Trust grows** because people see how decisions are made.
* **Ideas improve** since anyone can suggest changes based on their experience.
* **Participation expands** as barriers to involvement disappear.

## How does our campaign use Open Source?

Instead of hidden rooms and private documents, we use clear online tools (like GitHub) so anyone can:

* **Read our policies and strategies:** Check out how we plan to tackle issues like housing and healthcare.
* **Suggest changes:** Found a typo or have a better way to phrase something? You can easily suggest edits.
* **Join discussions:** Help shape our plans by contributing your insights and experiences.

| **Repository (Repo)** | A public folder where we keep all campaign materials.             |
| **Issue**             | A task or idea noted publicly, like a community noticeboard.      |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | A suggested change anyone can propose.                            |
| **Fork**              | Making a personal copy to experiment and suggest improvements.    |

## Your First Open Source Action: (Easy!)

Here's a simple way to get started:

1. Go to any document in our repo.
2. Click the pencil ‚úèÔ∏è icon.
3. Make your change (fix a typo or clarify a sentence).
4. Click "Propose changes".

That's it! Someone will review your suggestion and merge it in if it helps improve the campaign.

## Why You Should Get Involved

Your voice matters. Just like a community dinner is better when everyone contributes their favorite dish, our campaign becomes stronger when more people pitch in.

Together, we can create politics that are open, fair, and inclusive.
