# Contribution Paths — How You Can Help 🌟

Everyone has something valuable to offer our campaign. Whether you've got five minutes or five hours, there's a meaningful way for you to help:

## 🕐 Quick Contributions (5-15 minutes)

**Perfect if you're short on time or new to volunteering:**

* **Fix a Typo**: Spot an error or unclear wording? Click the edit icon and suggest a quick fix.
* **Star & Share the Repo**: Help more people find us by starring ⭐ our GitHub repository and sharing it on social media.
* **Log a Quick Issue**: Notice something we should address or improve? Open a new issue with a brief description.

## 🕒 Medium Contributions (30-60 minutes)

**Ideal for an evening or weekend:**

* **Write a Field Note**: Share insights or feedback from your community without sharing any personal details.
* **Translate Content**: Help us reach more neighbors by translating campaign materials into Spanish or other languages.
* **Design a Graphic**: Create a flyer or social media graphic using our templates.

## 🕔 Deeper Contributions (1-3 hours)

**Great if you're passionate about an issue or skill:**

* **Draft a Policy Proposal**: Suggest improvements or new ideas on housing, healthcare, or economic policies.
* **Review Proposals**: Read and provide feedback on others' proposals, helping improve our collective plans.
* **Create Educational Materials**: Develop guides, tutorials, or explainer materials to help new participants join the campaign.

## 🌟 Leadership Contributions (Ongoing involvement)

**For those looking to take an active role in their neighborhood or issue area:**

* **Neighborhood Lead**: Coordinate activities, facilitate local discussions, and help new participants.
* **Issue Area Champion**: Take ownership of a key issue (housing, healthcare, economy), helping drive conversations and improvements.
