# Welcome to Castro for Georgia's Open-Source Campaign 🌱

**You're stepping into something special.**

Most political campaigns run behind closed doors—decisions hidden, policies drafted by insiders, and strategies kept away from the very people they impact.

**We're doing things differently.**

Think of our campaign as a **community garden**: everyone can see what's being planted, anyone can pitch in to help it grow, and we all share the harvest.

## What does "Open-Source" mean here?

Usually, "open-source" describes software where the code is public, so anyone can read it, suggest improvements, or reuse it. We're taking that same spirit and applying it to politics:

* **Transparency**: All our policies, materials, and plans are available right here for you to see.
* **Participation**: You don't need special permission to help out—just jump in.
* **Collaboration**: Good ideas come from everywhere. If you spot a typo, have a better way to explain something, or know an issue your neighbors face, you can directly suggest improvements.

## Grassroots Organizing + Open Source = Powerful Change

If you've ever organized a neighborhood cookout, you know grassroots organizing. Neighbors share the work, resources, and success. Open-source is just like that, but online and with tools that help more people participate:
