# Our Campaign Vision 🌟

**Castro for Georgia** isn't just a political campaign—it's a movement to build a future where every working family in Georgia's 5th District thrives. Our vision is built around three core "North Stars":

## 🌟 1. A Home You Can Afford & Keep 🏘️

We believe that housing is a fundamental human right. Right now, too many of our neighbors struggle with rising rents, evictions, and displacement.

**Our Plan:**

* **Affordable Housing Guarantee:** Ensuring everyone who works 40 hours can afford stable housing.
* **Tenant Protections:** Strengthen laws against unjust evictions and rent hikes.
* **Community Ownership:** Support community land trusts and cooperative housing models that put power back in the hands of residents.

## 🌟 2. Healthcare Is a Human Right ❤️‍🩹

Healthcare shouldn't be determined by income or employment status. We envision a future where medical debt and lack of access are relics of the past.

**Our Plan:**

* **Medicare for All:** Universal, comprehensive healthcare without premiums, co-pays, or deductibles.
* **Expand Healthcare Access:** Reverse hospital closures and support neighborhood clinics and telehealth initiatives.
* **Protect Reproductive Rights:** Guarantee full access to reproductive healthcare and defend against attacks on personal healthcare choices.

## 🌟 3. Dignified Work & A Fair Economy 💪

Every Georgian deserves a job that pays fair wages, offers stability, and respects workers' rights.

**Our Plan:**

* **Living Wages:** Ensure a \$20/hour minimum wage and eliminate tipped wages.
* **Support Unions:** Make it easier for workers to organize, negotiate fair contracts, and advocate for their rights.
* **Fair Economy Legislation:** Hold corporations accountable, prevent worker exploitation, and protect small businesses.

## How Open Source Empowers Our Vision

Our campaign uses an open-source approach to:

* **Demonstrate transparency:** You see exactly how decisions and policies are developed.
* **Invite collaboration:** Your lived experience and input shape better solutions.
* **Foster accountability:** We openly track our progress and hold ourselves to clear goals.

## Join the Movement

You don't need special skills or experience—just a willingness to help build a fairer future. Here's how you can start:

* **Join our discussions:** Share your ideas and feedback openly.
* **Contribute directly:** Suggest improvements or take on a task that matches your interests.
* **Spread the word:** Help more people get involved and understand what's at stake.

Together, we will make Atlanta and Georgia's 5th District a true example of working-class prosperity, healthcare justice, and housing security.
