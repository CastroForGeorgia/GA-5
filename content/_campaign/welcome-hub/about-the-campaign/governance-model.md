# How Decisions Are Made — Our Open Governance Model 🗳️

In our campaign, transparency and democracy aren't just slogans—they shape every decision we make. Here's exactly how our open-source governance model works, explained simply and clearly:

## 🌱 Core Principles

1. **Transparency:** Decisions are made openly. Anyone can see how and why something was decided.
2. **Participation:** Everyone is encouraged to weigh in—whether you're a seasoned organizer or brand new.
3. **Accountability:** Decisions are documented, public, and revisable. Nobody holds unchecked power.

## 📌 How It Works: The Process Explained

### Step 1: Propose an Idea 💡

Anyone can suggest an improvement or a new idea:

* Open an "Issue"—think of this as pinning your idea on a public noticeboard.

### Step 2: Discuss & Refine 🗣️

Community members discuss the idea openly:

* Conversations happen transparently on the Issue's comment thread.
* Ideas are refined collaboratively, shaping better solutions together.

### Step 3: Submit a Proposal ("Pull Request") 📑

Once an idea is ready for consideration:

* Submit a "Pull Request" (PR). This is like formally suggesting changes to our shared materials.
* The PR clearly details the changes, why they matter, and their intended impact.

### Step 4: Review & Approve ✅

Proposals undergo a public review period:

* **72-Hour Lazy Consensus:** If a proposal gets two approvals 👍 and no objections 🚫 within 72 hours, it moves forward.
* If objections arise, further discussion happens openly, seeking consensus.

### Step 5: Merge & Implement 🎯

Approved proposals are merged into our official documents and action plans:

* Changes become official campaign positions, strategies, or actions.
* Everyone sees exactly what's been decided and why.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                        | What They Do                                                        | Checks & Balances                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contributors (everyone)** | Suggest ideas, discuss, review proposals                            | Follow Code of Conduct, accountable to community            |
| **Neighborhood Leads**      | Facilitate local discussions, review local proposals                | Accountable to local community, can be recalled by majority |
| **Maintainers**             | Facilitate discussions, manage proposal merges, ensure transparency | Must document all decisions publicly                        |

## 🔍 Conflict Resolution

Conflicts or disagreements are resolved in a structured, respectful way:

1. **Open Discussion:** Seek compromise openly in the Issue or PR.
2. **Maintainer Mediation:** If unresolved, Maintainers step in to mediate.
3. **Community Decision:** Final appeal goes to broader community discussion and consensus.

## 🔄 Forking: The Ultimate Accountability

If community trust breaks down or governance falters:

* The community can "fork"—copy—the entire campaign. This means accountability is built into our model: we must earn your trust constantly.
