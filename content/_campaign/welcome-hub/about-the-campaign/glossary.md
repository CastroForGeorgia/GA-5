# Campaign Glossary ðŸ“š

Our open-source campaign uses some special terms. Here's a simple guide to what they all mean, so you can dive right in with confidence:

## General Open-Source Terms

* **Open Source:** Sharing ideas, plans, and work openly so anyone can see, use, and improve them.
* **Repository (Repo):** Our online folder where we store all campaign materials (like a public filing cabinet).
* **Fork:** Making your own personal copy of our repo to suggest changes or improvements without affecting the main version.

## GitHub-Specific Terms

* **Issue:** A public note or task that identifies something to fix, improve, or discussâ€”like posting a note on a community board.
* **Pull Request (PR):** A formal suggestion to change or improve documents or files. Others review and approve before changes are accepted.
* **Merge:** When a suggested change (PR) is officially accepted and becomes part of our official documents.

## Campaign Organization Terms

* **Maintainer:** People responsible for reviewing and accepting contributions, helping facilitate discussions, and ensuring transparency.
* **Contributor:** Anyone who helps out by suggesting ideas, improvements, or actively participating in discussions.
* **Neighborhood Lead:** Community members who help manage local activities and discussions in specific neighborhoods.
* **Community Mentor:** Experienced volunteers who guide newcomers, answer questions, and help everyone feel comfortable contributing.

## Decision-Making & Governance

* **Lazy Consensus:** Decisions are made if no one objects within a certain time (usually 72 hours) after at least two approvals. This method encourages action and prevents unnecessary delays.
* **Governance:** How decisions are made and how our campaign stays fair, transparent, and accountable to everyone involved.
* **Conflict Resolution:** How we handle disagreements openly and respectfully, ensuring everyone's voice is heard.

## Miscellaneous Terms

* **Code of Conduct:** A set of guidelines ensuring respectful and positive interactions within the campaign. Everyone agrees to follow this to maintain a welcoming environment.
* **Transparency:** Making our work and decisions openly accessible, ensuring accountability and trust.
* **Forkability:** The idea that our campaign's materials can be freely copied and adapted by others, ensuring we remain accountable and share good ideas widely.
