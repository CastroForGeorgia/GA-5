## 🚀 Getting Started (3-Step Workflow)

### 1. Pick a Policy Area & Task

Visit our [Issues page](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/issues) and filter by labels like:

* `policy`
* `research-needed`
* `help wanted`
* Specific policy labels (e.g., `housing`, `healthcare`).

Claim an issue by commenting (e.g., *"I can help research housing affordability data!"*).

### 2. Conduct Your Research

* Use reliable sources (academic studies, government data, reputable media).
* Document your sources clearly (include links, citations, summaries).
* Keep your research organized and easy for others to verify.

### 3. Submit Your Findings

* Option **A: Directly via GitHub (recommended)**:

  * Navigate to the appropriate `policy-lab` folder.
  * Click ✏️ **Edit** and add your findings directly, or create a new markdown file (e.g., `housing-affordability-data.md`).
  * Submit a **Pull Request** (PR) clearly titled (e.g., "Housing Affordability Data Research").

* Option **B: Via Issues/Comments**:

  * Paste your research directly into the Issue comments if short and concise.

---

## 📖 Writing & Editing Policies

* Find the relevant policy document (e.g., `housing-policy.md`).
* Propose your edits or additions via a **Pull Request**.
* Clearly explain the rationale for your changes in the PR description.

**Example PR Title:**
`"Edit: Clarify eviction protections (Housing Policy)"`
