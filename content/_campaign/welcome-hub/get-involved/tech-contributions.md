# 🛠️ Tech Contributions at Castro for Georgia

Welcome, technologists, coders, and digital innovators! Your skills can help build the first fully open-source congressional campaign platform right here in Georgia's 5th District.

Whether you're a web developer, data scientist, or automation wizard, there's a space here for you to make a tangible impact.

---

## 🖥️ What We're Building

Our tech team creates, maintains, and enhances digital tools empowering grassroots activism, transparency, and community participation. Projects include:

* **Campaign website** – responsive, multilingual, accessible.
* **Volunteer app (Mantle)** – safe, privacy-first resource hub.
* **Data dashboards** – real-time visualizations of campaign engagement, voter priorities, and community feedback.
* **Automations (GitHub Actions)** – bots that streamline contributions, welcome newcomers, and generate insights.

## 📂 How Tech Projects are Organized

All tech contributions live in:

```
campaign/
├─ campaign-hq/
│   └─ tech-and-data/        ← main tech workspace
│       ├─ website/
│       ├─ volunteer-app/
│       ├─ dashboards/
│       └─ actions-automations/
```

Each subfolder includes a detailed `README.md` that explains the project setup, goals, and how you can get started quickly.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (For Tech Contributors)

### Step 1: Pick a Task (Issue)

* Visit our [Issues page](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/issues).
* Filter by labels like:

  * `tech`
  * `help wanted`
  * `good first issue`

Claim a task by commenting directly on the Issue!

### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

You have two easy options:

* **Option A (Recommended): Codespaces**

  * One-click setup on GitHub: instant dev environment in the browser.
  * Simply click "Open in Codespaces" on the repo homepage.

* **Option B: Local Setup**

  * Clone the repository locally.
  * Follow specific instructions in each project's README.md to set up your local environment.

### Step 3: Make Your Contribution

* Work directly in your Codespace or local copy.
* Commit changes clearly and descriptively (e.g., `fix: responsive header issue`).
* Submit a **Pull Request** (PR) for review:

  * PR title clearly describes changes.
  * Reference the original Issue number (e.g., "Closes #123").

## 🛡️ Security and Privacy Guidelines

We prioritize community safety and data privacy:

* **Never commit:** Personal info, API keys, database credentials.
* **Use mock data:** For testing and demo purposes.
* **Security scanning**: Automatic scans run on PRs to detect sensitive info.

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Features You'll Love

* **Codespaces:** Zero-config dev environments. No local setup needed.
* **GitHub Actions:** Automate repetitive tasks (welcome bots, nightly reports, CI/CD).
* **Projects (Kanban):** Track your progress and see what's needed most urgently.
* **Secret scanning:** Automatically catch accidental secrets before they merge.
