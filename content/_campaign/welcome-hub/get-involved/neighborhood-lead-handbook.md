## 🌟 What Does a Neighborhood Lead Do?

## 📂 Where You Organize on GitHub

Your main workspace is your neighborhood folder:

```
campaign/
├─ neighborhoods/
│   └─ [your-neighborhood]/
│       ├─ field-ops/          ← canvassing, yard signs, etc.
│       ├─ mutual-aid/         ← local support and help
│       ├─ [your-neighborhood]-hub/  ← central discussion and info
│       └─ captains-room/      ← planning & strategy space for leads
```

Each subfolder includes a `README.md` with clear guidance and ideas for organizing.
