# 📦 Offline Contributions Guide

**How to Support an Open-Source Campaign Without Ever Touching a Computer**

You don't need to be online 24/7—or know how to use GitHub—to make a meaningful impact in this campaign. If you can talk to neighbors, help organize flyers, or collect stories, you can help power this movement.

This guide is for **elders, neighbors, and everyday organizers** who want to contribute offline, in ways that are just as valuable as digital work.

---

## 🤲 Why Offline Contributions Matter

Our campaign is building power **from the ground up**. That includes:

* Seniors at church who organize food drives.
* Neighbors who speak up at tenant meetings.
* Moms passing out flyers at school pick-up.
* People who can't access GitHub but still show up for their community.

You're part of this, and this guide is here to show you how.

## 🧾 Reporting Offline Contributions

### 1. Tell Your Neighborhood Lead

If you're not using GitHub yourself, just tell your lead:

* What happened
* What's needed
* If follow-up is required

They'll post the note or task for you.

### 2. Use "Paper to GitHub" Tools

We're building simple ways to translate your offline work into digital updates:

* **Text-only submission number** (coming soon)
* **Call-in phone tree** for weekly updates
* **Paper → digital** bridge volunteers (you pass us your notebook—we log the details)

## 📝 Sample Offline Report (to Give a Lead)

```txt
[Name] — Miss Ruth (Oakland City)
[Date] — June 28
[Event] — Porch talk with 3 neighbors
[Outcome] — Yard sign requests from 2 homes (Avon Ave)
[Needs] — 10 more flyers for next week
```

Your Lead will log this in a GitHub Issue under `oakland_city`, tag it as `field-note` or `yard-sign`, and make sure it gets addressed.

## 🧑‍🏫 Don't Use GitHub? No Problem

We'll always make sure there's a human you can:

* Call
* Text
* Hand a flyer to
* Meet at a porch meeting or event

They'll bridge your contribution into our system.
