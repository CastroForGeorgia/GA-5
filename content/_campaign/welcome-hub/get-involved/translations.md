## 📚 How Translation Works on Our GitHub Repo

We manage translations directly through our GitHub repository to make collaboration easy, transparent, and accessible. Here's how:

### 1. Find Translation Tasks

Visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/issues) and look for labels like:

* `translations`
* `es` (Spanish)
* `vi` (Vietnamese)
* or your specific language code.

### 2. Choose a File to Translate

Translation files live inside the main folders, in clearly marked subfolders:

```
campaign/
├─ welcome-hub/
│   └─ translations/
│       ├─ es/  ← Spanish translations
│       └─ vi/  ← Vietnamese translations
├─ campaign-hq/
│   └─ translations/
│       ├─ es/
│       └─ vi/
└─ neighborhoods/
    └─ translations/
        ├─ es/
        └─ vi/
```

* **Example:** To translate the "Quick Start Guide," locate it at `welcome-hub/translations/es/quick-start-guide.md`.

### 3. Translate the File

* **Option A: Directly on GitHub (Easy, recommended)**

  1. Go to the original English file (e.g., `quick-start-guide.md`).
  2. Click ✏️ **Edit**, copy the content.
  3. Navigate to your language folder (e.g., `translations/es/`), create a new file (`quick-start-guide.md`), and paste your translated text.

* **Option B: On your computer**

  * Clone the repository, translate the file locally, and submit a **Pull Request**.

### 4. Submit Your Translation

Open a Pull Request (PR) with your translated document:

* Clearly label the PR, e.g., "Spanish Translation – Quick Start Guide."
* Our translation team will quickly review and merge your contribution.

## 🔍 Reviewing Translations

Even if you don't feel comfortable translating, your help reviewing translations for accuracy and clarity is invaluable:

* Find translation PRs labeled `translations` and `needs review`.
* Leave comments directly on the PR if you see ways to improve clarity or accuracy.
