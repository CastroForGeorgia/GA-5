# 🎨 Content Standards & Style Guide

This guide outlines how we create campaign materials that are **accessible, empowering, and aligned with our values**.

All contributions—text, graphics, photos, videos, or code—should reflect the dignity and grit of working-class communities.

---

## 🗣️ Tone & Language

- Speak directly to real people, not policymakers.
- Use **plain, active language** (8th–10th grade reading level).
- Be **confident, not condescending**—we lead with belief in our people.
- Center **working families**, not just policies.
- Avoid acronyms and insider jargon unless clearly defined.

---

## 🧑‍🦽 Accessibility Guidelines

We're committed to making this campaign accessible to all—online and offline.

### For Visual Content:
- **Alt-text** required for all images.
- Avoid color-only meaning (e.g., red vs. green alone).
- Use **high-contrast colors** for text and backgrounds.
- Choose **readable fonts** and sizes (min 16pt for body text).

### For Videos:
- **Captions required** for all public-facing videos.
- Avoid flashing/strobing effects.
- Include descriptive titles and summaries.

## 🪧 Messaging Style

- **Affirmative > Negative**  
  → "We believe 40 hours should be enough to raise a family."  
  ← not: "We oppose the current system."

- **People > Problems**  
  → "Low income families in Mechanicsville are organizing for fair rent."  
  ← not: "Housing policy in Atlanta is broken."

- **Actionable > Abstract**  
  → "Join this week's field training"  
  ← not: "Stay involved over the long term"

## 🖼️ Image & Media Guidelines

- Use **original photos** or Creative Commons–licensed images (CC0, CC-BY).
- Include photographer credit in the image README or PR description.
- Avoid tokenizing or exploitative imagery—show real dignity and joy.
- Don't upload images of minors unless you have documented consent.
