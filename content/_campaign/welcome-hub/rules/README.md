# 🚦 Rules of the Road (Quick Overview)

We’re building the first fully open-source, people-powered congressional campaign.  
To protect our contributors, neighbors, and communities, these rules guide how we work together.

## 🧭 Our 5 Core Commitments

### 1. Respect Everyone  
Speak with care. Welcome newcomers. Debate ideas, not people.

### 2. Protect Privacy  
Never share anyone’s personal or sensitive info. Use neighborhoods, not street names. Think before you post.

### 3. Contribute in Good Faith  
Be honest about your intentions. Share feedback that builds. Don’t derail discussions or mislead.

### 4. Follow the Code of Conduct  
We use the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](./code-of-conduct.md). Harassment, hate, or abuse are not tolerated.

### 5. Ask When in Doubt  
Use the [Help Desk Discussion](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/discussions/categories/help-desk) for questions. Tag `@moderators` to flag issues.
