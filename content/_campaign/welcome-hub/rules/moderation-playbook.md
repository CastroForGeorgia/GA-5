# üõ°Ô∏è Moderation & Community Enforcement Playbook

Our campaign is open-source and people-powered‚Äîwhich means everyone deserves to feel safe contributing and organizing here.

This playbook outlines how moderation works, what to expect, and how to raise concerns respectfully and transparently.

---

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Moderation Roles

| Role | Who | Abilities |
|------|-----|-----------|
| **Moderators** | `@moderators` GitHub team | Remove content, lock threads, issue warnings or bans |
| **Maintainers** | Repo admins and core contributors | Merge PRs, escalate issues to moderators |
| **Community Members** | You! | Report violations, flag safety concerns, support others with kindness |

---

## üö® What Triggers Enforcement?

We act when someone's behavior:
- Violates the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)
- Posts private or sensitive information
- Uses exclusionary or discriminatory language
- Harasses or threatens other contributors
- Deliberately disrupts, trolls, or floods discussions

---

## ü™ú Enforcement Process (Adapted from Contributor Covenant v2.1)

1. **Informal Warning**  
   - Friendly reminder in public or private: "Hey, please review our Code of Conduct."

2. **Moderation Action**  
   - Content removed, comment hidden, or thread locked.  
   - Short explanation posted by a Moderator.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   - Contributor blocked from the repo for a set time (24 hours to 7 days).  
   - Used for repeated or escalated behavior.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   - For egregious or repeated violations (e.g., hate speech, doxxing, stalking).  
   - Appeals available (see below).

---

## üì¨ How to Report Violations

You can report violations in any of these ways:

- Tag `@moderators` in an Issue or Discussion (public, for minor issues)
- Email **conduct@castroforgeorgia.com** (private, for serious cases)
- Use the [Help Desk Discussion](https://discord.gg/ep6dBqPjhG/categories/help-desk) to ask questions or seek support

All reports are handled **confidentially** and **as promptly as possible**.

---

## üëÇ Appeals & Restoration

If you've been warned or restricted and believe it was in error:

1. Contact the moderators via email: **conduct@castroforgeorgia.com**
2. Include a short explanation and a link to the original incident.
3. Moderators will review as a group and reply within 5‚Äì7 days.

We believe in accountability, not cancellation. If you're learning and committed to our values, there's room to come back stronger.

## ‚ú® Our Values in Action

Moderation isn't about control‚Äîit's about **protecting the collective work** of a grassroots movement. We welcome mistakes, growth, and hard conversations‚Äîbut never at the expense of someone's dignity or safety.

Thank you for helping make this space open, safe, and rooted in community care.
