# 🔒 Privacy & Safety Guidelines

Our campaign operates out in the open. That transparency is powerful—but it also means we must protect the privacy and safety of our neighbors, volunteers, and communities.

This guide outlines **what should never be shared publicly** on GitHub.

## 🚫 Never Post:

| Type of Information | Examples |
|---------------------|----------|
| ❌ **Personal Details** | Full names, phone numbers, home addresses |
| ❌ **Sensitive Status** | Immigration status, disability, legal status |
| ❌ **Medical Info** | Diagnoses, treatments, private health concerns |
| ❌ **Exact Locations** | “123 Main St.” — use streets or neighborhoods only |
| ❌ **Photos of Minors** | Unless consent is documented & shared privately |

---

## ✅ What You Can Share

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| ✅ **Neighborhood Reference** | “Request from Dill Ave in Oakland City” |
| ✅ **Internal Ticket ID** | “See FieldLog #173 (private CRM)” |
| ✅ **Anonymous Testimony** | “A tenant shared they’re behind on rent” |
| ✅ **Flyers & Materials** | Social graphics, event posters, public docs |
| ✅ **Consent-Based Photos** | “Photo taken with verbal OK at town hall” |

## 💡 Why It Matters

- We’re protecting undocumented neighbors, survivors, elders, and families who trust us.
- We’re modeling a better way to do politics—with safety, not surveillance.
- We’re creating space where everyone feels safe contributing.

---

## 🛠️ How to Handle Sensitive Info

- **Write it down securely** (paper form, CRM system, or FieldLog).
- Reference the internal ticket number in GitHub (e.g., `Request #204`).
- Never upload sensitive PDFs or photos directly to the repo.

If you’re unsure, tag a moderator or ask in the [Help Desk Discussion](https://github.com/CastroForGeorgia/campaign/discussions/categories/help-desk).

## 🧼 If Something Slips Through

If you see someone post sensitive info by accident:

1. **Immediately comment:** "Let’s move this to a private channel."
2. **Tag `@moderators`** to redact the info or lock the thread.
3. **Follow up** with the person kindly and privately if possible.

**Safety is a form of solidarity. Let’s protect each other.**
