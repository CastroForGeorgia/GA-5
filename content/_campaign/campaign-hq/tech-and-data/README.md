# 🧑‍💻 Tech & Data Hub

This is the home for all the campaign's technical tools, infrastructure, and data workflows.

Whether you're a dev, designer, data analyst, or curious volunteer—this space is where we build systems to power an open-source, community-driven campaign.

## 🔐 Ethics & Guardrails

We treat civic data as sacred:
- We **do not** collect, log, or analyze user PII
- We **never** share immigrant, medical, or legal status data
- We use GitHub, not private spreadsheets, for public-facing info
- Our code is open-source—but governed with care

---

## 📌 Priorities

- AI tools that serve, not surveil
- Offline-friendly tools for canvassers and community hubs
- Low-code contributions encouraged
- Multilingual support for all voter-facing tools
