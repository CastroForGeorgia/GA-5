## ✊ Ground Rules

- Lived experience matters—organizers, tenants, and neighbors are experts too
- We cite sources clearly and respect differing opinions during policy debates
- This is a judgment-free space for ideas and iteration

Let’s make GA‑05 a place where working people can live, grow, and stay rooted.
