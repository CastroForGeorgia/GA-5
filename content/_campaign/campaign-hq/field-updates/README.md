# 🚶🏽 Final Field Reports

This folder contains **public summaries** of offline campaign work: canvassing, mutual aid, voter outreach, and organizing wins from the field.

Neighborhood-specific, in-progress updates should go in the [`neighborhoods/`](../../neighborhoods/) folders.  
This space is for archiving and publishing **formal reports** and highlights that help tell our collective story.
