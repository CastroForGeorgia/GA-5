### **How We Win: By Organizing, Neighbor by Neighbor**

This campaign isn't funded by corporate PACs or special interests. Our power comes from one place: **you**.

Our strategy is simple but powerful: we're building a people-powered movement that connects every street and every neighborhood in our district. We win by showing up, listening to our neighbors, and organizing our communities, one meaningful conversation at a time.

**Ready to get involved?**

### **Lead the Change: Become a Neighborhood Captain**

Ready to take your involvement to the next level? **Neighborhood Captains** are the backbone of our grassroots strategy. They are the dedicated, on-the-ground leaders who serve as the main point of contact for their community, organizing their blocks and ensuring their neighbors' voices are central to our movement.

**As a Neighborhood Captain, you will:**

* **Act as the trusted point of contact** for the campaign in your neighborhood.
* **Organize** local meet-and-greets, canvassing events, and Get-Out-The-Vote efforts.
* **Share key campaign updates** and connect your neighbors with resources and information.

If you're ready to lead the charge for a better future, we need your leadership. Once you sign up, you'll get a special invitation to our exclusive #neighborhood-captains channel on Discord to connect directly with other leaders and the campaign team.

**Let's build this movement, together.**
