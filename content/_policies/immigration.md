# Immigration: A Just and Practical Approach to Reform

## Building a System Based on Amnesty and Opportunity

America has always been a nation of immigrants, yet our current system relies on detention, fear, and bureaucracy instead of solutions that strengthen families and communities. In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we believe in an immigration policy built on amnesty, opportunity, and integration, ensuring that hardworking people can contribute to our society without fear of deportation or family separation.

We prioritize:

* Providing a clear and achievable pathway to citizenship through amnesty.
* Ending the use of detention camps and mass deportations.
* Integrating immigrants into the economy through job training and support for immigrant-owned businesses.
* Keeping families together by ending separations and streamlining the legal process.

## Our Commitment

America’s strength has always been its diversity, and our policies should reflect that. We believe that people who live, work, and contribute to our society deserve a real path to citizenship, not a lifetime of fear. Amnesty is about human dignity, economic growth, and justice. We are committed to creating an immigration system that works for everyone in Georgia's 5th District.
