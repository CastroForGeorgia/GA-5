# Immigration: A Just and Practical Approach to Reform

## Building a System Based on Amnesty and Opportunity

America has always been a nation of immigrants, yet our current system relies on detention, fear, and bureaucracy instead of solutions that strengthen families and communities. In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we believe in an immigration policy built on amnesty, opportunity, and integration, ensuring that hardworking people can contribute to our society without fear of deportation or family separation.

We prioritize:

* Providing a clear and achievable pathway to citizenship through amnesty.
* Ending the use of detention camps and mass deportations.
* Integrating immigrants into the economy through job training and support for immigrant-owned businesses.
* Keeping families together by ending separations and streamlining the legal process.

## Urgent Immigration Challenges

### A Broken System

Millions of undocumented individuals live and work in our communities but remain in legal limbo. The current system keeps millions in the shadows, limiting their ability to fully contribute.

### Inhumane and Wasteful Spending

Detention centers waste billions of taxpayer dollars and fail to solve immigration challenges. The government contracts with for-profit detention centers that profit from human suffering.

### Separated Families and Weakened Communities

Mass deportations tear families apart and weaken local economies. The broken system forces immigrants to wait decades for legal status, often separated from their loved ones.

## Our Comprehensive Immigration Reform Plan

### 1. Make Amnesty the Foundation of Reform

* Pass federal amnesty legislation to provide a clear and achievable pathway to legal residency and citizenship for longtime residents, workers, and families.
* End the decades-long backlogs by streamlining applications and fixing the broken system.

### 2. End Detention Camps and Mass Deportations

* Shut down private, for-profit immigration prisons by ending government contracts.
* Replace detention with community-based case management programs that allow immigrants to remain with their families.
* Focus enforcement on real public safety threats, not families, workers, or asylum seekers.

### 3. Integrate Immigrants into the Economy

* Invest in job training, apprenticeship programs, and reskilling for immigrants to connect them with industries in need of labor.
* Provide small business grants, low-interest loans, and streamlined licensing to support immigrant entrepreneurs.

### 4. Keep Families Together

* End the separation of families at the border and throughout the legal process.
* Expand funding for immigration legal services and ensure newly legalized immigrants have access to healthcare, education, and other social services.
