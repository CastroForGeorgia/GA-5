# Reproductive Rights: Protecting Freedom, Ensuring Access

## Reproductive Justice is Non-Negotiable

Reproductive rights are under attack across the country, and Georgia’s 5th Congressional District is no exception. We must take bold action to ensure that no one is forced to travel out of state, struggle financially, or suffer from medical neglect just to get the care they need. This fight is about more than just abortion—it’s about health, dignity, and freedom.

We prioritize:

* Codifying the right to choose into federal law.
* Expanding access to reproductive healthcare, including free contraception and family planning services.
* Making prenatal, birthing, and postnatal services free for all families.
* Addressing the systemic health disparities that harm Black women and low-income communities.

## Urgent Challenges to Reproductive Rights

### Georgia’s Maternal Mortality Crisis

Georgia has the 2nd highest maternal mortality rate in the nation, at 33.9 deaths per 100,000 births. This crisis is even more severe for Black women, who face higher risks of complications due to systemic healthcare disparities.

### Disproportionate Harm to Vulnerable Communities

Restrictive laws disproportionately harm Black women, low-income families, and rural communities. In Atlanta's underserved neighborhoods, hospital closures and a lack of funding make access to care even worse.

## Our Comprehensive Plan for Reproductive Justice

### 1. Codify the Right to Choose

* Enshrine abortion access into federal law to prevent restrictive state policies.
* End unnecessary barriers like waiting periods and burdensome clinic regulations.
* Repeal the Hyde Amendment so that Medicaid can cover abortion services.

### 2. Expand Access to Reproductive Healthcare

* Guarantee free contraception and family planning services for all.
* Increase federal support for local reproductive health centers to ensure access in underserved areas.

### 3. Address Racial and Economic Health Disparities

* Invest in maternal health programs tailored for Black women and low-income communities.
* Direct funding to hospitals and clinics serving these communities and ensure culturally competent medical training for providers.

### 4. Make Birthing and Maternal Care Free

* Ensure all prenatal, birthing, and postnatal services are free for families.
* Include full reproductive care, including free birthing and hospital care, in a Medicare for All system to remove financial barriers.

## How This Benefits Georgia’s 5th District

* **Legal Protections for Women’s Rights**: Federal protections will ensure access in Georgia, preventing the state from controlling a woman’s body.
* **Guaranteed Access to Healthcare**: Women in Atlanta and surrounding communities will have full reproductive healthcare access without cost or restriction.
* **Health Equity for All Residents**: Targeted investments and culturally competent care will close racial and economic health disparities.
* **Free Birthing Services for Families**: No parent will have to go into debt for bringing a child into the world.
