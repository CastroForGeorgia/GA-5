# Reproductive Rights: Protecting Freedom, Ensuring Access

## Reproductive Justice is Non-Negotiable

Reproductive rights are under attack across the country, and Georgia’s 5th Congressional District is no exception. We must take bold action to ensure that no one is forced to travel out of state, struggle financially, or suffer from medical neglect just to get the care they need. This fight is about more than just abortion—it’s about health, dignity, and freedom.

We prioritize:

* Codifying the right to choose into federal law.
* Expanding access to reproductive healthcare, including free contraception and family planning services.
* Making prenatal, birthing, and postnatal services free for all families.
* Addressing the systemic health disparities that harm Black women and low-income communities.

## Our Commitment

We believe that healthcare is a right, not a privilege—no matter where you live. Women deserve the right to control their own healthcare decisions, access affordable care, and give birth without financial strain. We will fight to protect reproductive freedom, expand healthcare access, and ensure that no woman is denied the care she needs.
