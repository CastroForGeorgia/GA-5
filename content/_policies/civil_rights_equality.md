# Civil Rights and Equality

## Equal Rights, Real Power

In Georgia’s 5th District, I’m fighting to end discrimination in all its forms and build a democracy where every person—no matter their race, gender, income, disability, or who they love—has real power, safety, and protection under the law. We will not accept a system that punishes working-class families while protecting abusive institutions and wealthy interests.   

We will fight for:

* **Protect voting rights and our democracy** by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, restoring federal oversight, and expanding automatic and early voting so every eligible voter in Georgia can cast a ballot without obstruction.

* **End police violence and racial profiling** by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, banning discriminatory practices, demilitarizing police, and investing in community-based safety programs like Atlanta’s own diversion and care models.

* **Guarantee equal pay and economic justice** by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, strengthening protections against workplace discrimination, and expanding support for minority- and women-owned small businesses so our economy works for everyone.   

* **Secure full LGBTQ+ equality nationwide** by passing the Equality Act and defending the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ and especially transgender people in healthcare, housing, education, and public life.

* **Expand disability rights and true accessibility** by strengthening the Americans with Disabilities Act, passing the Disability Integration Act, and fully funding community-based supports, transportation, and infrastructure that allow disabled Georgians to live with independence and dignity. 

* **Defend fair housing and protect communities from discrimination** by enforcing and expanding fair housing laws, including the Fair Housing Improvements Act, and pairing them with serious investment in affordable housing to prevent displacement in neighborhoods like those across Atlanta’s West and South Sides.   

* **Constitutional gender equality and reproductive freedom** by securing final ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and treating reproductive rights as core civil rights—protecting the right to choose, ending attacks on bodily autonomy, and making maternal care safe and accessible for all.

## Our Commitment

Civil rights are not abstract—they determine whether our neighbors can vote, walk home safely, get a job, marry who they love, or find a place to live without fear or discrimination. In Congress, I will stand with working-class and marginalized communities in Georgia’s 5th District, use every tool we have to enforce these protections, and never trade away anyone’s dignity for political convenience.   

**Join us in this fight—and let’s build a district where every person is safe, seen, and truly equal under the law.**
