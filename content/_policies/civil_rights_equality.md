# **Civil Rights and Equality: Justice for Georgia’s 5th District**

## **Equal Rights Are Non-Negotiable**

Systemic discrimination, racial injustice, and economic inequality persist, holding back the working-class families of **Georgia’s 5th District**. It's time to push back boldly against political cowardice. We refuse to compromise—civil rights must be fully protected, expanded, and enforced.

We will champion progressive legislation that others fear to embrace, fighting tirelessly to ensure **every Georgian has equal opportunities, dignity, and protection under the law**.

## **The Reality: Systemic Inequality Persists**

- **🏛️ Voting rights** under attack through restrictive laws aimed at silencing minority communities.
- **⚖️ Police brutality and racial profiling** disproportionately harm Black and Latino families.
- **💰 Persistent wage gaps** and discrimination keep women and people of color economically disadvantaged.
- **🌈 LGBTQ+ individuals** remain unprotected in many states, including Georgia.
- **♿ Accessibility barriers** continue excluding disabled Georgians from full participation in public life.

This injustice must end—our campaign stands with the working class against systemic inequality.
