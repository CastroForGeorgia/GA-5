# Open Government: A Transparent, Accountable Future

## Government Should Work for the People—Not Behind Closed Doors

Trust in government is at an all-time low because too many decisions are made in secrecy, public funds are mismanaged, and people are left out of the political process. In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we are fighting for a government that is fully transparent, accountable, and collaborative. This is your government; it’s time to take it back.

We prioritize:

* Making all policy drafts, updates, and legislative progress available to the public in real-time.
* Creating transparent, interactive budget dashboards for tracking public spending.
* Implementing participatory budgeting and community-led policy creation.
* Strengthening oversight through independent audits and public performance scorecards.

## Urgent Challenges in Government Accountability

### Lack of Transparency Hurts Communities

When budgets are not easily accessible, public funds are mismanaged. Decisions are made without input from the people they impact the most. This allows corruption and inefficiency to thrive because leaders are not held accountable.

### People Deserve a Voice

Residents should have direct input on policy decisions, budgeting, and community projects. A government that listens to its people is a government that works better for everyone.

## Our Comprehensive Plan for Open Government

### 1. Full Transparency in Government Operations

* Publish all policy drafts, updates, and finalized documents on open platforms like GitHub for public review.
* Provide residents with real-time access to legislation, amendments, and votes.
* Expand access to meeting minutes, reports, and budget data so residents can track how decisions are made.

### 2. Transparent Budgeting and Spending

* Create real-time, interactive budget dashboards where residents can see exactly how public funds are being spent.
* Publish quarterly spending reports in plain language.
* Establish resident-led budget review committees to hold government spending accountable.

### 3. Collaborative Governance and Public Engagement

* Host monthly in-person and virtual town halls where residents can ask questions and offer ideas.
* Invite residents to help draft policies through community-led policy sprints.
* Allow residents to vote on how a portion of public funds are allocated through participatory budgeting.

### 4. Stronger Oversight and Accountability

* Require third-party financial and ethical audits to ensure responsible governance.
* Track and publish all changes to policies and budgets to ensure transparency.
* Release regular performance metrics on how well public programs are working through public scorecards.
