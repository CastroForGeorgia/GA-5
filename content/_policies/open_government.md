# Open Government: A Transparent, Accountable Future

## Government Should Work for the People—Not Behind Closed Doors

Trust in government is at an all-time low because too many decisions are made in secrecy, public funds are mismanaged, and people are left out of the political process. In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we are fighting for a government that is fully transparent, accountable, and collaborative. This is your government; it’s time to take it back.

We prioritize:

* Making all policy drafts, updates, and legislative progress available to the public in real-time.
* Creating transparent, interactive budget dashboards for tracking public spending.
* Implementing participatory budgeting and community-led policy creation.
* Strengthening oversight through independent audits and public performance scorecards.

## Our Commitment

For too long, government decisions have been made behind closed doors; that ends now. Our Open Government Policy ensures that every decision, every dollar, and every document is accessible to the people of Georgia’s 5th Congressional District. This is your government, and it should be transparent, accountable, and responsive to you.
