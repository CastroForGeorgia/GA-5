# Free Palestine: A Pro-Humanity Stance on the Genocide in Gaza

## Standing with People, Not Governments

Our campaign is founded on the unwavering principle that governments often do not represent the will of their people. Just as the current administration does not represent true American values, the governments of warring nations do not speak for the citizens who suffer under their rule. Our solidarity must be with the people, especially when their governments impose systems of oppression that echo the darkest parts of our own history, like [Jim Crow](https://youtu.be/ginvzPX3WJQ?feature=shared&t=43){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

When it comes to the genocide happening in Gaza, our position is clear: we are pro-humanity, period. This is not an abstract issue; it is a personal one, rooted in family and the fundamental belief that all people deserve dignity and freedom. We refuse to stand by while human rights are violated and will always stand with oppressed people everywhere.

We prioritize:

* An immediate end to the genocide and apartheid policies victimizing the Palestinian people.
* Supporting "[H.R.3565](https://www.blockthebombs.org/) - Block the Bombs" bill to block the following weapons to Israel: BLU-109 bunker busting bombs, MK80 series bombs, GBU-39 small diameter bomb variants, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), SPICE gliding bomb assemblies, 120mm tank ammunition, and 155mm artillery ammunition, including white phosphorus munitions.
* Standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine, recognizing that all who suffer under authoritarian regimes deserve support.
* Rejecting campaign funding from any government or entity complicit in genocide.
* Upholding civil rights for all and fighting systems of oppression, whether they are called [Jim Crow or apartheid](https://youtu.be/ginvzPX3WJQ?feature=shared&t=43){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We will never compromise our pro-humanity stance and will always fight for a world where every person’s dignity and rights are protected from systems of oppression like Jim Crow and apartheid.
