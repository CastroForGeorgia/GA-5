# Free Palestine: A Pro-Humanity Stance on the Genocide in Gaza

## Standing with People, Not Governments

Our campaign is founded on the unwavering principle that governments often do not represent the will of their people. Just as the current administration does not represent true American values, the governments of warring nations do not speak for the citizens who suffer under their rule. Our solidarity must be with the people, especially when their governments impose systems of oppression that echo the darkest parts of our own history, like [Jim Crow](https://youtu.be/ginvzPX3WJQ?feature=shared&t=43){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

When it comes to the genocide happening in Gaza, our position is clear: we are pro-humanity, period. This is not an abstract issue; it is a personal one, rooted in family and the fundamental belief that all people deserve dignity and freedom. We refuse to stand by while human rights are violated and will always stand with oppressed people everywhere.

We prioritize:

* An immediate end to the genocide and apartheid policies victimizing the Palestinian people.
* Standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine, recognizing that all who suffer under authoritarian regimes deserve support.
* Rejecting campaign funding from any government or entity complicit in genocide.
* Upholding civil rights for all and fighting systems of oppression, whether they are called [Jim Crow or apartheid](https://youtu.be/ginvzPX3WJQ?feature=shared&t=43){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## The Urgent Challenges We Face

### Echoes of Historical Injustice

The policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing being enacted are not new; they are a modern manifestation of the same evil that fueled Jim Crow in America. We have been through this before and know the devastating end result. When we see a system that strips people of their rights and humanity based on their identity, we have a moral obligation to call it what it is and fight it.

### Complicity in Government

Too many politicians, including those in the Democratic party, refuse to call out the genocide and apartheid being committed. They take money from the very governments enacting these policies, proving their loyalty is not with human rights. This moral decay within our political leadership cannot continue.

## Our Unwavering Stance

### 1. A Clear Stand Against Genocide

Our campaign is unequivocal: We do not support the genocide in Palestine. This is a deeply personal issue, as members of my own family have been directly impacted. My niece is half-Palestinian, and her family was fortunate to escape the war. This is not a political game; it is a matter of life and death, and our stance will always be pro-humanity.

### 2. Justice Has No Exceptions

You cannot claim to fight for civil rights while supporting apartheid. We recognize the rhetoric used to justify these atrocities because we have heard similar things in our own country after the Civil War. Justice must be applied universally. Standing with Palestine is standing with oppressed people everywhere. Our fight is against oppressive systems, and we will fight Jim Crow no matter where it rears its ugly head.

### 3. Rejecting Corrupting Influence

I don’t trust any politician to protect my family if they are taking money from a country committing genocide and apartheid. Our campaign will never accept such funding. We cannot allow our representatives to be bought by interests that are actively causing human suffering.

### 4. Supporting Humanitarian Efforts

Our solidarity extends beyond words. We actively support organizations providing essential resources and political education to Palestinians, such as the [Refaat Alareer Mobile Library](https://www.refaatlibrary.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. We believe in empowering communities and fostering hope even in the most difficult of times.

## Why This Matters for Georgia’s 5th District

### Upholding Our Shared Values

What has happened to the Atlanta that fights for human rights? This district has a legacy of standing up for justice. Our campaign reflects that spirit by refusing to look away from oppression, no matter where it occurs.

### A Representative You Can Trust

The people of GA-05 deserve a representative who is not compromised by foreign money or special interests. My refusal to take funds from entities committing atrocities ensures that my only loyalty is to the people and to the cause of human rights.

## Our Commitment

This campaign is rooted in the belief that peace, love, and justice will always prevail. We are committed to being a voice for the voiceless and standing in solidarity with all people suffering under authoritarian regimes. We will never compromise our pro-humanity stance and will always fight for a world where every person’s dignity and rights are protected from systems of oppression like Jim Crow and apartheid.
