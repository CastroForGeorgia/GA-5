# Healthcare for All: A Human Right

## Universal, Affordable, and Comprehensive Healthcare

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a privilege. We are committed to establishing **Medicare for All**, guaranteeing universal coverage without premiums, deductibles, or surprise bills. Our healthcare system will serve people—not profits.

We prioritize:

* Universal, comprehensive healthcare coverage, including mental health, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and long-term care.
* Eliminating medical debt and financial barriers to treatment.
* Lowering prescription drug prices through Medicare negotiations.
* Strengthening local hospitals and clinics, especially in underserved areas.
* Investing in healthcare professionals by reducing administrative burdens and increasing support.
