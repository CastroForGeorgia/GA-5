# Healthcare for All: A Human Right

## A Universal, People-First Public System

In Georgia’s 5th District, I’m fighting to replace a profit-driven maze with a **universal, individual state-run, single-payer system** that guarantees care—no gatekeeping by insurers, no games with networks, no “gotcha” bills. We will set clear rules, cap what families can ever pay, and put doctors and patients back at the center of care.

We will fight for:

* **Guarantee coverage for every resident** through public plan administered by each individual state.
* **Cap out-of-pocket costs at 10% of household wages**—a hard ceiling that ends medical debt traps.
* **Use one transparent, statewide price list tied to middle-class wages**, so care stays affordable and providers are paid fairly.
* **Cover prenatal, birth, and postpartum care at 100%**—no bills, no exceptions—so families can plan with confidence.
* **Include mental health care** alongside medical care with the same access standards.
* **Ban direct-to-consumer medical advertising** for prescription drugs and devices, and end hospital/insurer ad games that confuse patients.
* **Strengthen local hospitals and clinics**, especially in underserved neighborhoods.
* **Reduce administrative burdens** so clinicians spend time healing people, not chasing codes.

## Urgent Healthcare Challenges

### Unaffordable and Unequal Care

Working families are priced out by premiums, deductibles. Care should be based on need—not on a credit score.

### Medical Debt Crisis

Medical debt is a poverty machine. A hard **10% of wages cap** ends the cycle and gives families a real budget line for health.

### Prescription Drug Prices

Pharma hikes and glossy ads drain wallets. We’ll negotiate prices and ban direct-to-consumer ads that drive up costs.

### Mental Health Neglect

The system still treats mental health like a sidecar. We won’t. Care will be fully included and timely.

### Healthcare Inequities

Black, brown, immigrant, rural, and low-income communities face worse access and outcomes. Our plan bakes equity into prices, access standards, and funding.

## The Universal Public Health

### 1) Automatic, Universal Coverage

* Every resident is **automatically enrolled** in a single, state-run public plan.

### 2) A Hard 10% of Wages Cap on Out-of-Pocket Costs

* Copays and coinsurance—where used—**can never push a family over 10% of annual wages.**
* After the cap, the plan pays 100% for the rest of the year.

### 3) Zero-Cost Prenatal, Birth, and Postpartum Care

* Prenatal visits, delivery (including C-sections), doulas, lactation support, postpartum checkups, and newborn care are **covered at 100%**. Healthy moms and healthy babies are non-negotiable.

### 4) Mental Health, Substance-Use, and Crisis Services Included

* Therapy, psychiatry, peer support, mobile crisis, and evidence-based substance-use treatment are **in the core benefit**, with the same access standards as any other medical service.

### 5) One Fair Price List, Tied to Middle-Class Wages

* We adopt a single, statewide **Public Health Fee Schedule** with **prices anchored to median wage growth**—and targeted boosts for primary care, mental health, and rural access. Prices are public and simple to understand.

### 6) Ban Medical Advertising

* **No direct-to-consumer advertising** for prescription drugs and medical devices.
* Hospital and insurer communications must be standardized, factual disclosures on quality and price.

### 7) Strong Local Care

* Keep community hospitals openexpand primary care and urgent care, and fund language access, disability access, and culturally competent care.

### 8) Fewer Hoops for Clinicians

* Slash redundant authorizations and billing red tape. Let nurses, doctors, therapists, and midwives do their jobs.

### 9) Lower Prescription Drug Costs

* Use public bargaining power, automatic generic/biosimilar substitution, and transparent pricing to stop price-gouging.
