# Universal Public Health

## A Universal, People-First Public System

In Georgia’s 5th District, I’m fighting to replace a profit-driven maze with a **universal, individual state-run, single-payer system** that guarantees care—no gatekeeping by insurers, no games with networks, no “gotcha” bills. We will set clear rules, cap what families can ever pay, and put doctors and patients back at the center of care.

We will fight for:

* **Guarantee coverage for every resident** through public plan administered by each individual state.
* **Use one transparent, statewide price list tied to middle-class wages**, so care stays affordable and providers are paid fairly.
* **Cover prenatal, birth, and postpartum care at 100%**—no bills, no exceptions—so families can plan with confidence.
* **Include mental health care** alongside medical care with the same access standards.
* **Strengthen local hospitals and clinics**, especially in underserved neighborhoods.
* **Reduce administrative burdens** so clinicians spend time healing people, not chasing codes.

## Our Commitment

Healthcare should never depend on income or zip code. Together, we will build an public system that treats care as a right, ends medical debt, and invests in the health workforce that keeps our communities alive. **Join us in this fight—and let’s win a system that puts people over profits.**
