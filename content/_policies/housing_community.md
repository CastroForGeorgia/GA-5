# Housing: Dignity, Stability, Community

## Affordable Housing Is a Fundamental Right

Housing should be a guarantee, not a gamble. Our campaign is fighting to build and protect homes that are affordable, healthy, and rooted in community—because people come before profits.

## Full Support: The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act

We fully support the **Green New Deal for Public Housing Act** (Ocasio‑Cortez/Sanders/Ramirez). This bill is the bold federal partner Atlanta needs—and I will champion it in Congress. Here’s what it means for GA‑05:

* **Build and Repair at Scale:** Modernize and decarbonize nearly a million public housing homes nationwide; fix mold, lead, and failing systems; and build *net‑new* homes by **repealing the Faircloth Amendment** so we can finally grow the supply of deeply affordable housing.
* **Lower Bills, Healthier Homes:** Deep energy retrofits, full electrification, air quality and water upgrades, on‑site renewables, and heat resilience—cutting utility costs for families and improving health outcomes.
* **Union Jobs, Local Work:** Up to hundreds of thousands of good‑paying, union jobs with project labor agreements, Buy American, and anti‑misclassification safeguards. Training and hiring pipelines focused on residents and local workers.
* **Tenant Power and Protections:** One‑for‑one replacement, a guaranteed **right to return**, expanded resident councils.
* **Stronger Public Housing Agencies:** Tools to generate and retain revenue (e.g., community solar) so housing authorities can maintain homes at high standards.

**Our commitment:** I will fight to pass this bill, repeal Faircloth, and bring these investments to Atlanta so our public housing communities are safer, greener, and bigger—meeting the real demand for homes people can afford.

## What This Delivers for GA‑05

* **More deeply affordable homes:** Repealing Faircloth and fully funding modernization means *adding* public housing units—not just replacing them.
* **Healthier, safer housing:** Mold and lead abatement, better ventilation, and comfortable indoor temperatures.
* **Lower household costs:** Efficient buildings and on‑site renewables shrink monthly bills.
* **Real careers, not temp gigs:** Union construction and maintenance jobs that build wealth in our communities.
* **Stronger neighborhoods:** Rooting new housing near transit and jobs to cut commute times and keep families together.

## Our Promise

We’re building a movement that treats housing as a human right. We will modernize what exists, build what’s missing, and guarantee that families are not pushed out of the communities they’ve sustained for generations. Together, we can deliver homes, health, and dignity for every neighbor in Georgia’s 5th District.
