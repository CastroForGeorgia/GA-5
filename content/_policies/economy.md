# Building an Economy That Works for Everyone

## A \$25 Minimum Wage and Economic Fairness

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we're fighting for an economy that truly serves the working class. At the heart of this fight is guaranteeing a **\$25 minimum wage**, ensuring that working 40 hours a week is enough to raise a family and build a secure future.

Our campaign prioritizes workers over corporate profits by:

* Raising the minimum wage to **\$25/hour**, indexed to inflation.
* Closing tax loopholes so billionaires and corporations pay their fair share.
* Regulating automation to protect jobs and ensure worker retraining.
* Supporting small businesses and local entrepreneurs to build community wealth.

## Standing Strong for Workers

Our commitment is clear: We refuse to accept an economy rigged for the wealthy. By prioritizing the working class, raising wages, and ensuring corporate accountability, we can build an economy that genuinely serves everyone.

**Join us in fighting for an economy rooted in fairness, dignity, and opportunity for all.**
