# Building an Economy That Works for Everyone

## Guaranteeing a \$25 Minimum Wage and Economic Fairness

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we're fighting for an economy that truly serves the working class. At the heart of this fight is guaranteeing a **\$25 minimum wage**, ensuring that working 40 hours a week is enough to raise a family and build a secure future.

Our campaign prioritizes workers over corporate profits by:

* Raising the minimum wage to **\$25/hour**, indexed to inflation.
* Closing tax loopholes so billionaires and corporations pay their fair share.
* Regulating automation to protect jobs and ensure worker retraining.
* Supporting small businesses and local entrepreneurs to build community wealth.

## Challenges We Must Address

### Tax Inequality and Corporate Loopholes

* Billionaires exploit loopholes, such as stock leveraging, to avoid paying fair taxes.
* Corporations offshore profits, dodge taxes, and penalize workers through outsourcing.

### Wage Stagnation

* The federal minimum wage is drastically insufficient amid rising inflation.
* Many full-time workers still live in poverty.

### Unregulated Automation

* Workers are displaced by AI and automation without adequate protections or retraining.

### Small Businesses Under Pressure

* Local businesses struggle to compete with corporate giants and face barriers to funding.

## Our Comprehensive Economic Justice Plan

### 2. Close Tax Loopholes and Ensure Corporate Accountability

* Impose penalties for corporations outsourcing jobs abroad.

### 3. Regulate Automation to Protect Workers

* Enact laws requiring transparency and oversight of AI systems impacting workers.
* Provide comprehensive retraining and wage insurance programs for displaced workers.
* Offer incentives to businesses that proactively retrain workers instead of replacing them.

### 4. Empower Small Businesses and Worker Cooperatives

* Expand grants and loans to worker-owned businesses and cooperatives.
* Strengthen local economies through community infrastructure projects tied to local hiring.
* Pass labor protections, such as the PRO Act, to support fair wages and unionization.
