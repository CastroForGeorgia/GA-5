# Artificial Intelligence: Technology That Works for Workers

## AI Must Serve People—Not Replace Them

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we are committed to ensuring that the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation enhances human potential and expands economic opportunity—without leaving anyone behind. Our goal is a future where AI works for us, not against us.

We prioritize:

* Protecting workers from displacement and ensuring AI enhances, not eliminates, human labor.
* Providing free reskilling and education programs for a future-ready workforce.
* Strengthening social safety nets for workers affected by automation.
* Promoting ethical AI development with public and worker oversight.

By investing in people-first AI policies, we will lead the way in building an economy that works for everyone in Georgia's 5th District.
