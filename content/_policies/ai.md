# Artificial Intelligence: Technology That Works for Workers

## AI Must Serve People—Not Replace Them

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we are committed to ensuring that the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation enhances human potential and expands economic opportunity—without leaving anyone behind. Our goal is a future where AI works for us, not against us.

We prioritize:

* Protecting workers from displacement and ensuring AI enhances, not eliminates, human labor.
* Providing free reskilling and education programs for a future-ready workforce.
* Strengthening social safety nets for workers affected by automation.
* Promoting ethical AI development with public and worker oversight.

## The Challenges We Face

### Job Displacement Without Protections

AI and robotics are replacing workers in manufacturing, logistics, retail, and white-collar industries. Companies often prioritize automation for profit, ignoring the impact on workers who are displaced without adequate protections or retraining.

### Lack of AI Oversight and Transparency

AI-driven hiring, firing, and wage decisions often occur without human oversight or transparency. This leaves workers excluded from discussions on how technology is implemented in their workplaces.

### Inequitable Access to AI Jobs

Without investment in accessible reskilling programs, displaced workers are left behind. Low-income communities and workers of color have fewer opportunities to enter AI-driven industries.

## A People-First AI Agenda

### 1. Protect Jobs Through Worker-Centric AI

* Require companies to use AI to assist and enhance human labor, not replace it.
* Mandate that companies conduct public impact reports and commit to worker retraining before automating jobs.
* Ban AI from making firing and wage decisions without human review and establish worker-led AI oversight committees.

### 2. Reskill and Educate for the Future

* Provide free or low-cost training programs in AI maintenance, robotics, and automation management, accessible in multiple languages.
* Establish public AI learning centers and tech hubs in Georgia’s 5th District to train residents and support small businesses using automation ethically.

### 3. Strengthen Social Safety Nets

* Expand unemployment protections and provide stipends for workers who enroll in retraining programs.
* Launch a Universal Basic Income (UBI) pilot program in the district to support workers displaced by automation and ensure they have access to healthcare and mental health support.

### 4. Promote Ethical Development and Public Oversight

* Require companies to conduct community impact studies before deploying AI-driven automation.
* Mandate AI explainability so workers understand how AI affects their jobs and create public oversight boards to hold companies accountable.
