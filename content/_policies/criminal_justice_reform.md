# Civil Rights and Equality: Justice for Georgia’s 5th District

## Equal Rights Are Non-Negotiable

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we believe that civil rights are non-negotiable. Systemic discrimination, racial injustice, and economic inequality hold back working-class families. We are committed to fighting for legislation that protects and expands civil rights for every resident.

We prioritize:

* Strengthening voting rights and protecting democracy.
* Ending police violence and racial profiling.
* Ensuring equal pay and economic opportunity for all.
* Protecting LGBTQ+ and disability rights.

## Urgent Challenges to Civil Rights and Equality

### Key Statistics

* **Voter Suppression:** Since 2020, Georgia has enacted some of the most restrictive voting laws in the nation, leading to a significant drop in voter registration among minority communities.
* **Police Brutality:** Black Georgians are **3 times more likely** to be killed by police than their white counterparts.
* **Wealth Gap:** The median net worth of a white family in Georgia is nearly **8 times** that of a Black family.
* **LGBTQ+ Discrimination:** Over **60%** of LGBTQ+ Georgians report experiencing discrimination in their daily lives.

### What This Means for Georgia's 5th District

These are not just statistics; they are the lived realities of our neighbors. Discriminatory practices in voting, policing, and employment create barriers that prevent families from thriving. When our civil rights are not protected, our communities are less safe, less prosperous, and less free.

### 3. Secure Economic and Gender Equality

* Pass the **Paycheck Fairness Act** to close the gender and racial wage gaps.
* Strengthen protections against workplace discrimination and expand opportunities for minority-owned businesses.

### 4. Protect LGBTQ+ and Disability Rights
