# Criminal Justice Reform: Justice Through Opportunity

## Building a Fair and Equitable Justice System

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, our criminal justice system must be reformed to emphasize rehabilitation, fairness, and community safety. We commit to ending mass incarceration, transforming policing, and investing in programs that address the root causes of crime.

We prioritize:

* Ending mass incarceration and excessive sentencing.
* Reforming policing practices and increasing accountability.
* Investing in community-based alternatives and rehabilitation programs.
* Ensuring supportive reentry programs for formerly incarcerated individuals.

## Urgent Challenges Facing Our Justice System

### Mass Incarceration

* Georgia has one of the highest incarceration rates globally, disproportionately impacting Black and brown communities.

### Racial and Economic Disparities

* Systemic biases result in higher incarceration rates for communities of color and economically disadvantaged groups.

### Unfair Cash Bail System

* Individuals remain incarcerated pre-trial solely due to their inability to afford bail, punishing poverty rather than criminal behavior.

### Mental Health Criminalization

* Lack of mental health services forces incarceration rather than providing essential treatment.

### Recidivism Due to Lack of Support

* Formerly incarcerated individuals lack necessary resources and opportunities for successful reintegration into society.

## Comprehensive Reform Plan

### 1. End Mass Incarceration

* Decriminalize non-violent offenses and expunge related records.
* Eliminate cash bail and adopt fair, risk-based systems.
* Reform sentencing laws to remove mandatory minimums and reduce harsh penalties.

### 2. Transform Policing and Ensure Accountability

* Promote community-led policing models.
* Ban racial profiling and discriminatory stop-and-frisk practices.
* Increase transparency and accountability through mandatory body cameras and independent oversight boards.

### 3. Invest in Rehabilitation and Community-Based Alternatives

* Expand restorative justice initiatives and youth diversion programs.
* Increase funding for community-based mental health and addiction treatment programs.

### 4. Support Effective Reentry Programs

* Provide job training, education, and housing assistance for returning citizens.
* Prohibit discrimination against formerly incarcerated individuals in employment and housing.
* Enhance mental health services to prevent recidivism.

### 5. Promote Holistic Community Safety

* Address root causes of crime through investments in education, job creation, and housing stability.
* Strengthen victim support services and trauma-informed care.
* Implement sensible gun safety measures, including universal background checks.
