# Why I'm Running for Congress in Georgia's 5th District

## Fighting for a Party that Puts People First

I'm running for Congress in Georgia's 5th District because the Democratic Party has abandoned its roots, prioritizing corporate interests over working-class people. It's time to reclaim our party and stand unapologetically for economic justice, civil rights, and transformative, meaningful change.

Our campaign is committed to:

* Rejecting all corporate donations to ensure loyalty only to the working class.
* Fighting relentlessly for affordable healthcare, higher wages, and economic dignity.
* Championing civil rights and true equity—beyond incremental change.
* Building grassroots movements that hold leaders accountable.

## The Urgency of Real Change

### A Party at a Crossroads

* Too many Democratic leaders accept the status quo while our bills rise, wages stagnate, and healthcare remains unaffordable.

### Standing with the Working Class

* Unlike politicians backed by corporate donors, I stand with renters, families, and working-class residents of GA-05.

### The Need for Immediate Action

* Incrementalism is inadequate—our community needs urgent, substantial change to thrive.

---

## Our Vision for Transformative Politics

### Political Multiplier for Change

* Leveraging technology and grassroots organizing to create a more inclusive and accessible political process.

### Cleaning House

* Ending corporate influence to reconnect the Democratic Party with the everyday lives of working people.

### Building a Movement

* Creating coalitions that demand accountability and prioritize community needs.

## Why This Fight Matters

* This campaign isn't just about winning; it's about building lasting power for working-class people.
* It's about reclaiming the Democratic Party for the people—not corporate interests.
