Andres Castro was motivated to run out of frustration with the current Democratic leadership, which he believes has stopped prioritizing the needs of the people. He sees leaders unwilling to listen, slow to act, and compromising on the promises made to working-class families. Andres is stepping up to provide bold, uncompromising leadership that puts the residents of Georgia's 5th Congressional District first.
