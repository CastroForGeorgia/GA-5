# About Andres Castro

## A Journey Rooted in Resilience and Community

My story began with courage—the courage of my parents, who came to this country undocumented from Acapulco, Mexico, determined to build a better future. Their sacrifices and resilience shaped my life's journey, teaching me early on about the power of hope, persistence, and community.

In 1996, after my parents separated, my mother brought our family to the Atlanta Metro area to start anew. Growing up in Marietta and Powder Springs, I witnessed firsthand the harsh realities of poverty, racism, and systemic injustice. These experiences instilled in me a deep commitment to economic justice and equity for all working families.

To support myself, I worked while earning my degree in Computer Science from Kennesaw State University. My education opened doors, ultimately leading me to become a staff software engineer. With years of experience in the tech industry, I've developed and managed complex systems and innovative solutions, gaining insight into how technology can serve people when designed with equity and accessibility in mind. However, I never forgot that success means little unless our communities thrive together.

## Family as the Heart of My Purpose

My family has always been my greatest source of strength and inspiration:

* My mother’s undocumented journey, filled with struggle and determination, continues to fuel my fight for immigration reform and dignity for every family.
* My niece, proudly half-Palestinian, has shown me the intersectional realities faced by marginalized communities, deepening my commitment to inclusive justice.
* My wife, a fierce feminist advocate, constantly inspires me to champion progressive values fearlessly.
* My younger brother’s service in the Coast Guard highlights the immense contributions and sacrifices working families make for our nation.
* My older sister, a small business owner, embodies the hardworking entrepreneurial spirit I'm committed to supporting through our grassroots campaign.

Now living in Oakland City, Atlanta, I’ve been privileged to purchase two side-by-side homes, ensuring our family remains close. Yet, I believe strongly that housing stability, economic security, and family unity must be accessible to everyone—not privileges reserved for the few.

## Building a Future Together

Our campaign for Georgia's 5th Congressional District is rooted in this journey—one shared by so many working-class families. Together, we'll fight for real solutions: economic justice, universal healthcare, workers' rights, and an end to systemic inequalities.

Join us in reshaping politics to serve people, not profits. Together, we'll build an Atlanta—and an America—that truly works for all of us.
