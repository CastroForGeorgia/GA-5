# About Andres Castro

## A Working-Class Advocate Running for Real Change

I'm Andres Castro, a working-class advocate, software engineer, and community organizer running for Congress in Georgia’s 5th District. I’m not a politician—I’m someone who understands firsthand the struggles of working families and is determined to build a government that genuinely puts people first.

Our campaign is dedicated to:

* Fighting for economic justice and affordable healthcare for every resident.
* Championing civil rights, equality, and meaningful opportunities for working families.
* Rejecting corporate donations and special interests to prioritize community needs.

## My Story

I was raised in Marietta and Powder Springs by an immigrant mother from Acapulco, Mexico. Growing up, I experienced poverty, racism, and systemic barriers firsthand. Determined to overcome these challenges, I worked multiple jobs to support myself through Kennesaw State University, where I earned a Computer Science degree.

Today, I proudly call Oakland City, Atlanta, home. As a homeowner, I've witnessed the transformative power of persistence and hard work—but individual success is incomplete if our broader community is left behind.

## My Family, My Strength

My family has taught me the value of resilience and community:

* My wife, a feminist advocate, inspires me daily to stand firm in our shared values.
* My younger brother, completing his service in the Coast Guard, reminds me of the sacrifices made by working families.
* My older sister, a small business owner, now helps lead our grassroots campaign.
* My niece, soon to graduate from Georgia State University, represents the future we are fighting for.

I've been fortunate to purchase two side-by-side homes to keep my family close—because family unity and economic stability should never be privileges but rights available to every family in Georgia’s 5th District.

## Our Commitment

This campaign isn't just about policy—it's about fundamentally reshaping politics to uplift working people. Together, we can ensure every family has a fair shot at dignity, stability, and prosperity.

**Join us in building a future where government truly serves the people.**
