# **Artificial General Intelligence Policy: Putting People First**

The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics is transforming every corner of our economy and society. As Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes a reality, we face a critical choice: Will these advancements replace workers, or will they enhance human potential?  

In Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, we must lead with bold, forward-thinking policies that ensure AGI and other technologies work **for the people**, not against them. This policy focuses on protecting jobs, empowering workers, and building a future where technology uplifts every community.

---

## **Policy Objectives**

### **1. Empower Workers with Technology**
- **Exoskeletons and Worker Enhancement Tools:**
  - Introduce programs to provide workers with wearable exoskeletons and assistive technologies to reduce physical strain, prevent injuries, and boost productivity.  
  - Partner with industries like manufacturing, construction, and logistics to subsidize these tools, ensuring technology supports workers rather than replacing them.

- **Human-Centric Technology:**
  - Pass legislation requiring that AI and robotics implementations enhance human capabilities before companies can replace human jobs.

---

### **2. Protect Job Security**
- **Automation Impact Assessments:**
  - Mandate that companies conduct and publicly share community impact assessments before deploying automation, showing how they will protect jobs or retrain affected workers.

- **Worker Representation in Tech Decisions:**
  - Establish committees with labor representation to oversee the deployment of AI in workplaces, ensuring workers have a voice in how technology affects their jobs.

- **Pro-Worker AI Development Standards:**
  - Develop federal guidelines ensuring AI cannot make decisions about hiring, firing, or wages without direct human oversight.

---

### **3. Invest in Reskilling and Education**
- **Accessible Training Programs:**
  - Launch free or low-cost reskilling programs for workers, teaching skills in AI maintenance, robotics programming, and other future-focused fields.
  - Offer flexible learning options, including online and evening classes, to accommodate working adults.

- **Community Tech Hubs:**
  - Create neighborhood-based tech hubs where residents can learn new skills, collaborate on projects, and explore entrepreneurship opportunities.

- **Focus on Equity in Education:**
  - Ensure immigrants, low-income workers, and those without advanced degrees have equal access to reskilling programs with support in multiple languages and formats.

---

### **4. Strengthen Social Safety Nets**
- **Universal Worker Support Programs:**
  - Expand unemployment benefits to include retraining stipends and longer coverage for workers displaced by automation.
  - Explore Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a safety net for families navigating the transition to an automated economy.

- **Healthcare and Mental Health Support:**
  - Guarantee affordable healthcare for displaced workers and their families.
  - Provide mental health services tailored to help individuals cope with job loss and career transitions.

---

### **5. Promote Economic Democracy**
- **Worker Ownership of AI-Driven Companies:**
  - Incentivize the creation of employee-owned businesses in the AI and robotics industries, giving workers a stake in the profits generated by new technologies.

- **Local Innovation and Entrepreneurship:**
  - Establish grants and low-interest loans for workers and small business owners to develop AI-driven startups or expand their operations in ways that create local jobs.

---

### **6. Advocate for Ethical AI Development**
- **Ethics and Fairness First:**
  - Require all AI systems to undergo impact assessments that evaluate their effects on jobs, privacy, and community well-being.  
  - Mandate that AI is developed with transparency and accountability, ensuring it adheres to ethical standards that prioritize people over profits.

- **Community Oversight:**
  - Create citizen-led boards to provide input on the ethical deployment of AI and robotics, ensuring public accountability.

---

## **Action Plan**

### **Legislative Advocacy**
- Draft and introduce laws that incentivize the adoption of worker-enhancing technologies like exoskeletons and prohibit reckless automation practices.
- Collaborate with progressive leaders to pass strong worker-protection legislation and establish ethical AI guidelines.

### **Grassroots Mobilization**
- Organize town halls, workshops, and rallies to educate residents about the potential impacts of AGI and the tools available to protect jobs and livelihoods.
- Build coalitions with unions, local organizations, and small businesses to advocate for community-driven tech policies.

### **Community Partnerships**
- Partner with unions and educational institutions to develop worker-centric training programs tailored to local industries.
- Collaborate with tech companies to ensure AI adoption includes safeguards for workers and community input.

### **Monitoring and Transparency**
- Establish public dashboards to track the rollout of AI-related initiatives, showing how policies are protecting jobs and improving worker conditions.
- Conduct regular reviews of automation’s impact on jobs and make adjustments based on public feedback.

The rise of AGI is an unstoppable force, but its impact on society is not inevitable. By embracing policies that empower workers, protect jobs, and prioritize ethical development, we can build a future where technology serves as a partner in progress—not a threat to livelihoods.  

It’s time for **Georgia’s 5th Congressional District** to lead with bold, people-first policies that put workers and communities at the heart of the technological revolution. Together, we can ensure the future is bright, fair, and inclusive for everyone.
