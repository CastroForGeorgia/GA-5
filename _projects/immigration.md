# Immigration Policy: Embracing Amnesty for a Better Future

## Overview

**Amnesty** is the compassionate and practical path forward for our nation's growth and diversity. Our immigration policy for **Georgia's 5th Congressional District** is centered on Amnesty, recognizing it as a humane and effective alternative to big government detention camps and mass deportations. Inspired by personal experience, we advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that provides stability, opportunity, and dignity for all immigrants, ensuring that our district remains a beacon of hope and prosperity.

### **Why Amnesty Matters**

Deportation and detention camps are neither necessary nor beneficial for our nation's progress. Embracing Amnesty allows us to integrate immigrants into our society, strengthening our economy, fostering innovation, and enriching our cultural fabric. By centering our policy on Amnesty, we uphold the values of justice and equality, providing a clear and compassionate pathway for undocumented immigrants to become fully contributing members of our community.

## Personal Story: A Path Forward Without Mass Deportations

My commitment to Amnesty and immigration reform is deeply personal. My mother immigrated to the United States illegally, driven by the hope of providing a better life for our family. Facing the threat of deportation and the uncertainty of her future, she was granted Amnesty under the Reagan-era program. This opportunity transformed our lives. My mother became a U.S. citizen, secured stable employment, and was able to purchase her first home around $200kâ€”a milestone that provided our family with stability and the chance to thrive.

Our story is proof that with the right support and policies centered on Amnesty, immigrants can flourish and contribute significantly to our economy and society. It demonstrates that there is a way forward without resorting to big government detention camps and mass deportations. Instead, we can choose a path of compassion, integration, and shared prosperity.
