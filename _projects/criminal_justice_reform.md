# Transforming Criminal Justice: Building Safer Communities Through Opportunity

## Why Criminal Justice Reform Matters

Our **criminal justice system** is failing our communities. It disproportionately affects people of color, incarcerates individuals for minor offenses, and neglects the support needed to reintegrate into society. In **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, we believe in a fairer system that offers second chances, reduces recidivism, and fosters safer, more inclusive communities for everyone.
