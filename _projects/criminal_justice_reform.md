# Justice for All: Criminal Justice Reform

## Why We Need Change

Our current criminal justice system is broken. It unfairly targets communities of color, keeps too many people behind bars for minor offenses, and fails to help individuals get back on their feet. In **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**, we're committed to creating a system that treats everyone with fairness, offers second chances, and builds safer communities for all.

## Our Mission

- **End Unfair Treatment**
  - Stop the racial and economic biases that plague our justice system.
  
- **Cut Down on Overcrowded Prisons**
  - Reduce the number of people in jail for non-violent crimes.
  
- **Help People Rebuild Their Lives**
  - Provide support and resources for those leaving the justice system to prevent them from returning.
  
- **Legalize and Regulate Cannabis**
  - Remove cannabis from the list of criminal offenses, clear past convictions, and create a fair market that benefits our community.
  
- **Support Victims and Keep Our Communities Safe**
  - Offer better services for victims and implement strategies to prevent crime before it happens.

## How We’ll Achieve This

- **Alternative Sentences**
  - Use probation, community service, and other alternatives instead of jail for non-violent offenders.

- **Mental Health and Addiction Support**
  - Expand access to mental health services and addiction treatment within the justice system.

  - Legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use.
  - Clear past cannabis-related convictions to restore rights and opportunities for those affected.
  
- **Create a Fair Market**
  - Establish state-controlled licenses for cannabis businesses to ensure safe and responsible operations.
  - Tax cannabis sales to fund public programs like education, healthcare, and justice reform.
  
- **Support Those Affected**
  - Provide grants and training for individuals impacted by past cannabis laws to enter the legal market.

### 5. Support Victims and Prevent Crime
