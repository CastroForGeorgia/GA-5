# Education Policy: Restoring Public Education for a Brighter Future
    
## Overview
    
**Restoring Public Education** is the cornerstone of our vision for **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**. We believe that a robust public education system is essential for building strong families, empowering individuals, and driving our community forward. Our commitment is to ensure that every child receives a high-quality education, every teacher is valued and supported, and every family has the opportunity to thrive. Together, we can create an education system that works for everyone.
    
### **Why Restoring Public Education Matters**
    
Public education is the foundation upon which our community's future is built. It ensures that every child, regardless of their background, has access to the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. By restoring and strengthening public education, we address systemic inequalities, support our educators, and foster an environment where every student can reach their full potential.
    
## Personal Story: The Heart of Our Education Policy
    
Growing up in Marietta, Powder Springs, and Kennesaw, I attended Heards Ferry Elementary, Tapp Middle School, McEachern High, and Kennesaw State Universityâ€”all public institutions that shaped who I am today. These communities embraced me with open arms, teaching me the values of hard work, perseverance, and the strength found in unity. Even when faced with the heavy burden of poverty, I was determined not only to overcome our challenges but also to create opportunities for others facing similar struggles. My public education journey fuels my commitment to ensuring every child in our district has the chance to succeed.
