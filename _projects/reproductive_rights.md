# Women's Reproductive Rights and Care Policy

## Overview

Reproductive rights are not a privilege—they are fundamental human rights. Unfortunately, the political establishment has consistently failed women across the country, especially in **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**. Promises to protect our rights have fallen short, resulting in the erosion of access to essential reproductive healthcare services. We believe that every woman deserves the right to make informed decisions about her own body and to access comprehensive reproductive healthcare without barriers. Our commitment is unwavering: we will fight tirelessly to protect and expand these rights, ensuring that they remain accessible to all women.

### **High Maternal Mortality Rate**

Georgia's maternal mortality rate is among the highest in the United States. Between 2018 and 2021, the rate was **33.9 deaths per 100,000 live births**, compared to the national average of **32.9**.
