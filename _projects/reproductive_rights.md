# **Reproductive Rights: Protecting Freedom, Ensuring Access**  

## **The Fight for Reproductive Freedom**  

Reproductive rights are **non-negotiable**—yet in **Georgia’s 5th Congressional District** and across the country, they are under relentless attack. **Georgia ranks among the worst in maternal mortality** and faces systemic inequities that disproportionately harm Black women and low-income families.  

We must take bold action to **codify abortion rights, expand reproductive healthcare, and ensure free birthing services**. No woman should be forced into **financial hardship or denied care** because of where she lives or how much she earns.  

**We won’t back down. We won’t settle.**

## **Why This Matters**  

### 📉 **Georgia’s Maternal Mortality Crisis**  
- **33.9 deaths per 100,000 live births**—one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country.  
- **Black women** are disproportionately affected due to systemic healthcare disparities.  
- **Hospital closures** in rural and underserved areas make access even worse.  

Reproductive care is not just about choice—it’s about **life-saving healthcare**.
