# üè† Everyone Deserves a Home

## Overview

**Build Baby Build**

Housing is not just about shelter‚Äîit's about opportunity, dignity, and community. We believe that **everyone deserves a safe and affordable home**. Our **"200k Home Initiative"** is the centerpiece of our Housing Policy for **Georgia's 5th Congressional District**. This ambitious plan aims to revolutionize housing by constructing affordable homes priced around $200k, creating jobs for the homeless through a job works program, and empowering individuals to achieve homeownership. We reject the idea that only a few should have comfortable homes. Instead, we're committed to building vibrant, inclusive neighborhoods where everyone can thrive.

## Personal Story

My commitment to housing reform is deeply personal. My mother immigrated to the United States illegally, driven by the hope of providing a better life for our family. Despite the challenges she faced, her resilience and determination led her to be granted amnesty, and eventually, she became a U.S. citizen. One of her proudest achievements was purchasing her first home around $200k, a milestone that provided our family with stability and the opportunity to build a prosperous future.

This personal journey underscores the profound impact that affordable homeownership can have on individuals and families. It also highlights the barriers many face in accessing such opportunities. By advocating for the **"200k Home Initiative"**, we aim to replicate and expand these opportunities for more families in our district.

## The 200k Home Initiative: Build Baby Build
