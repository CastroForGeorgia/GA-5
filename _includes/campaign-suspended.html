        A Message from Andres and Megan Castro Regarding the 5th District Campaign
      </h1>
      <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-campaign-primary-dark/80">
        <p>To our supporters, volunteers, and neighbors:</p>

        <p>When we launched this campaign, we did so with a singular mission: to build a genuine, grassroots movement for the 5th District. Over the past few months, we have been overwhelmed by your generosity. From every event to every donation made, you proved that there is a deep hunger for change in Atlanta.</p>

        <p><strong>Today, we are sharing the difficult decision to suspend our campaign.</strong></p>

        <p>We entered this race with a clear roadmap and voluenteer and donor benchmarks to ensure a path to victory. While the momentum we've built together is undeniable, we have not reached the specific goals necessary in the time remaining to sustain a competitive race through the finish line. As a campaign rooted in transparency and accountability, we believe it is important to be honest about our path forward and the resources required to win.</p>

        <p><strong>The work for the 5th District does not end here.</strong></p>

        <p>While this specific campaign is concluding, the progressive movement in Atlanta is only getting stronger. We remain fully committed to this community and to helping this movement grow. We have learned invaluable lessons about what it takes to run as grassroots candidates, and we look forward to sharing those insights to help clear the path for those who come after us.</p>

        <p>To our donors, our volunteers, and our friends: your kindness and support have meant the world to us. We carry your stories and your energy with us as we continue the fight for a better Atlanta.</p>

        <p>With deepest gratitude,</p>

        <p><strong>Andres & Megan Castro</strong></p>
