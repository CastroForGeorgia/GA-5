  faq_items:
    - title: What is your creative process?
      description: My creative process is both structured and flexible, allowing for creativity and precision. It begins with an initial consultation where I gather information about your vision and goals. I then move to the brainstorming and conceptualization phase, where ideas are sketched out and refined. After your approval, I proceed with the creation phase, followed by final adjustments based on your feedback. This collaborative approach ensures that the final product is exactly what you envisioned.
    - title: How do you handle custom design requests?
      description: Handling custom design requests involves a personalized approach where I work closely with clients to understand their unique needs and preferences. The process begins with an in-depth consultation to discuss ideas, inspirations, and project goals. Based on this discussion, I create initial concepts and share them for feedback. Throughout the project, I maintain open communication, providing updates and making necessary adjustments to ensure the final outcome exceeds expectations.
    - title: How do you stay inspired and current with design trends?
      description: Staying inspired and up-to-date with design trends requires continuous learning and exploration. I regularly attend industry conferences, workshops, and exhibitions to gain fresh insights and perspectives. Additionally, I follow leading design blogs, publications, and social media channels to stay informed about the latest trends and innovations. Personal projects and experimentation also play a crucial role in keeping my creative skills sharp and evolving.
    - title: What is your typical turnaround time for a project?
      description: The turnaround time for a project varies depending on its complexity and scope. Typically, smaller projects like single illustrations or simple graphic designs can be completed within a week. More intricate projects, such as full branding packages or detailed custom artworks, may take several weeks to a few months. I always provide a clear timeline at the outset and ensure regular communication to keep clients updated on progress and any potential adjustments.
    - title: What payment methods do you accept?
      description: I accept a variety of payment methods to accommodate different preferences and needs. These include major credit cards, bank transfers, and digital payment platforms like PayPal. Payment terms and schedules are discussed and agreed upon at the start of the project, ensuring transparency and convenience for both parties. A deposit is typically required to begin work, with the balance due upon project completion.
    - title: What types of projects do you specialize in?
      description: I specialize in a wide range of creative projects, including graphic design, illustration, photography, and poster art. My portfolio encompasses branding, editorial design, and bespoke artwork tailored for both commercial and personal use. Whether it's a corporate identity project or a custom illustration, I bring a unique blend of artistic flair and technical expertise to every project. My goal is to deliver visually compelling solutions that resonate with the target audience.
