# A Journey Forged in Resilience and Unity

Hello, I'm **Andres Castro**, a passionate **Staff Software Engineer** dedicated to leveraging technology for societal good. My story begins on September 14, 1988, in Los Angeles, California. My mother's courageous journey from Acapulco, Mexico, in search of a better life embodies the spirit of millions who dream of opportunity and justice. After enduring years of hardship and abuse, she made the brave decision to move us—my older sister and me—to Georgia, leaving behind everything she knew to give us a fighting chance.

### Overcoming Adversity

Facing extreme poverty, we sometimes resorted to dumpster diving just to find our next meal. But through unwavering solidarity, resilience, and an unshakable belief in a better tomorrow, we overcame every obstacle that stood in our way.

Growing up in **Marietta and Powder Springs**, attending **Heards Ferry Elementary**, **Tapp Middle**, and **McEachern High**, I was embraced by the heart of metro Atlanta. These communities instilled in me the values of hard work, perseverance, and the power of standing together. Despite the crushing weight of poverty, I was determined not just to rise above our circumstances but to pave the way for others facing similar struggles.

### Navigating Economic Challenges

When the **2008 recession** hit, we—like countless hardworking families—faced the terrifying threat of losing our home. The system was rigged against us, favoring the wealthy and powerful, but through collective strength and relentless effort, we held on. This pivotal experience showed me firsthand how ordinary people suffer when the odds are stacked against them.

### Pursuing Education

With the lifelines of **Pell Grants**, the **HOPE Grant**, and **Federal Student Loans**, I graduated from **Kennesaw State University** with a degree in **Computer Science**. Without these crucial supports, higher education would have remained a distant dream—just as it does for too many Americans today. My education ignited a passion for technology and innovation and reinforced my belief that everyone deserves access to affordable education.

### Building a Supportive Community

Since 2018, I’ve been a proud homeowner in **Oakland City, Atlanta**—not just for myself, but also providing a safe haven for my extended family. My younger brother serves honorably in the **U.S. Coast Guard**, and my older sister—who became a mother at 17—fought her way out of poverty and managed to put my niece through college and persue her own dreams of owning a buisness. Our family's journey mirrors the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans everywhere. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the challenges we face and strengthened my conviction that the **American Dream** must be accessible to **all**—not just the privileged few.

### Personal Connections and Shared Experiences

I have also seen firsthand the impacts poverty has on all Americans, regardless of race or ethnic background, through the experiences of my wife, **Megan Castro**. Megan is from **Waycross, Georgia**—one of the state's poorest cities. She faced the same hardships of poverty, but with her family's support, she attended **Georgia State University** and strived for a better life. Like so many of us, she now carries the burden of student loan debt. Our shared experiences reinforce my understanding that economic struggles transcend race and background, fueling my determination to fight for a system that works for **everyone**.

### Professional Endeavors and Vision

As a **Staff Software Engineer**, I tackle complex problems every day. This experience gives me a unique perspective on how we can harness technology to serve the public good. I believe we can use innovation to make our government more transparent, efficient, and responsive to the needs of all people—not just corporate interests. By breaking down the barriers that keep ordinary citizens from engaging with their government, we can create a democracy that truly works for **everyone**.
