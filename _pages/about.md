# A Journey Forged in Resilience and Unity

Hello, I'm **Andres Castro**, a passionate **Staff Software Engineer** dedicated to leveraging technology for societal good. My story begins on September 14, 1988, in Los Angeles, California. My mother's courageous journey from Acapulco, Mexico, in search of a better life embodies the spirit of millions who dream of opportunity and justice. After enduring years of hardship and abuse, she made the brave decision to move us—my older sister and me—to Georgia, leaving behind everything she knew to give us a fighting chance.

Growing up in **Marietta and Powder Springs**, attending **Heards Ferry Elementary**, **Tapp Middle**, and **McEachern High**, I was embraced by the heart of metro Atlanta. These communities instilled in me the values of hard work, perseverance, and the power of standing together. Despite the crushing weight of poverty, I was determined not just to rise above our circumstances but to pave the way for others facing similar struggles.

### Overcoming Adversity

Facing extreme poverty, we sometimes resorted to dumpster diving just to find a pair of shoes. But through unwavering solidarity, resilience, and an unshakable belief in a better tomorrow, we overcame every obstacle that stood in our way.

I vividly remember the daily struggles that defined my early years:  

- Going into **lunch debt** in elementary school, feeling the weight of being unable to afford even a basic meal.  
- Witnessing the **abuse my mother endured** and her relentless determination to protect us despite unimaginable challenges.  
- Never owning a **yearbook** because it was a luxury we couldn’t afford, and the quiet sadness of not having those memories captured.  
- Feeling **embarrassed by my clothes**, knowing they made me stand out in ways I wished they didn’t.  
- Missing out on **field trips** and after-school clubs because we couldn’t pay for them, and because I had to help care for my younger brother.  
- Experiencing the helplessness of being unable to afford to take my mom to the **doctor** when she was sick.  
- Standing at the **pharmacy**, where prescriptions were only partially filled because we could afford the medication but not the painkillers.  
- In college, going to the **hospital** and walking away burdened by medical bills I couldn’t pay.  

Each of these moments left a lasting impact, fueling my commitment to fight for a society where no one has to endure these struggles.  


### Navigating Economic Challenges

When the **2008 recession** hit, we—like countless hardworking families—faced the terrifying threat of losing our home. The system was rigged against us, favoring the wealthy and powerful, but through collective strength and relentless effort, we held on.

I remember my mother needing to take on multiple jobs just to keep our home, as her serving job alone couldn’t keep up with the rising costs. The stress of falling behind on payments weighed heavily on her, and I could see how close we were to losing everything we had worked so hard to hold onto.  

What was most disheartening was watching the government bail out the banks that caused the crisis, while families like ours were left to fend for ourselves. These experiences opened my eyes to the deep inequities in our system—a system that prioritizes corporations and the wealthy over the needs of everyday people.  

This chapter of my life shaped my unwavering commitment to housing justice and economic reform. I believe everyone deserves a safe and stable home, and I will fight to ensure that no family has to endure the fear and uncertainty that mine faced during that tumultuous time.  

### Pursuing Education

With the lifelines of **Pell Grants**, the **HOPE Grant**, and **Federal Student Loans**, I graduated from **Kennesaw State University** with a degree in **Computer Science**. Without these crucial supports, higher education would have remained a distant dream—just as it does for too many Americans today. My education ignited a passion for technology and innovation and reinforced my belief that everyone deserves access to affordable education.

I carry vivid memories of the challenges and triumphs that marked my journey through school:  

- I remember the teachers who doubted me, the ones who tried to keep me down and forced me into **ESOL**, despite my abilities.  
- I remember the sting of racism I faced from some educators, but also the gratitude I hold for the teachers who believed in me and never gave up.  
- I remember the **spark of knowledge** ignited by those who inspired me to keep going, even when the odds seemed insurmountable.  
- I remember the burden of **student loan debt**, the **expensive books** and fees, and the constant financial juggling it took to stay enrolled.  
- I remember living at home to save money, and the day my **car broke down** on the way to school, making me wonder if I could even keep going.  

But I also remember the opportunities that changed my life:  

- The chance to **study abroad in Japan**, thanks to KSU's program, which opened my eyes to a world of possibilities.  
- The pride of my family when they saw me graduate, a moment of joy that made every late night and every struggle worth it.  
- The day I landed my **first job** out of school, proof that all the hard work, sleepless nights, and studying had paid off.  

These experiences showed me the transformative power of education and the barriers too many face in accessing it. They fuel my commitment to ensuring every student, regardless of background or income, has the support they need to achieve their dreams.  

### Building a Supportive Community

Since 2018, I’ve been a proud homeowner in **Oakland City, Atlanta**—not just for myself, but also providing a safe haven for my extended family. My younger brother serves honorably in the **U.S. Coast Guard**, and my older sister—who became a mother at 17—fought her way out of poverty and managed to put my niece through college and pursue her own dreams of owning a business.

When my wife and I moved into our home in 2018, we envisioned more than just a house—we wanted to build a hub of love, support, and resilience for our family and community. Since then, that vision has grown stronger each day:  

- We stood for justice by participating in **Black Lives Matter protests**, marching for equity and accountability.  
- When my mother contracted **COVID-19**, it was heartbreaking to see her unable to work and having to sell her house and retire early to Mexico, but we supported her through this life-changing moment.  
- We opened our doors to help a family member navigate **bankruptcy**, giving them a safe place to live and rebuild.  

At one point, our home was filled with family and love: my **sister**, my **21-year-old niece**, my **24-year-old brother**, my **60-year-old mother**, my wife, our **four dogs**, and **two cats**. Despite the challenges, I couldn’t have been happier—it was a testament to what family and community mean to me.  

Fulfilling a lifelong dream, I even managed to purchase the **house next door**, creating a space where my extended family could live together and support each other.  

Becoming a **Home Owner** was the culmination of not just my hard work, but the love, sacrifices, and encouragement of my family and community. I am profoundly grateful for the people who lifted me up, and now, my mission is to create opportunities for others to succeed—just as I was fortunate enough to do.
