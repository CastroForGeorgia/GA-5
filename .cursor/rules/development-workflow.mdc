# Local Development Workflow
- Install dependencies once with `npm install` and `bundle install`; `npm run setup` runs both.
- For active development, run `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server (`localhost:5173`) alongside `bundle exec jekyll serve` (`localhost:4000`).
- Run `npm run build` before production deploys; it builds hashed assets, runs image optimization, and executes a production Jekyll build into `_site/`.
- Never edit `_site/`; it is regenerated on each build.
- Use `npm run build-css` during styling work when you only need PostCSS/Tailwind output without the full dev stack.
