# Content Collection Guidelines
- Maintain YAML frontmatter: include `title`, unique `slug`, and `order` when sections need deterministic sorting.
- Keep slugs kebab-cased to match permalink structures in [`_config.yml`](mdc:_config.yml).
- Reference images by filename only; place new assets in [`assets/images/`](mdc:assets/images).
- Localized content mirrors English structureâ€”ensure corresponding files exist under each language directory when adding pages.
- Avoid embedding inline scripts or styles; use includes or assets instead so builds stay deterministic.
